      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to see not all newspapers are caught in a stupor &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_japanese_newspapers_are_trying_to_save_themselves.php&#34;&gt;the Japanese ones&lt;/a&gt; seem to actually be seeing their common interest and making something sort of useful to their readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see newspapers do stuff which is innovative instead of being stuck in the headlights and waiting to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, this adresses a real problem. On any commute I make with my iPhone, I theoretically can read all the news from the world&amp;rsquo;s best newspapers instead of grabbing a free newspaper from the box on the station. I&amp;rsquo;ve done so for a while, but lately I don&amp;rsquo;t bother anymore.
The reason I don&amp;rsquo;t bother is that it is too much hassle to lead the newspaper&amp;rsquo;s awful bloated websites over what passes for 3G in this part of the world, then select what I want to read and then read that. There are too many actions involved and the cognitive load is too great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
