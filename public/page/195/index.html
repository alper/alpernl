    <p>This video on BoingBoing is shocking in its absurdity but hardly unexpected given the current climate. If you pay any attention around you in metropolitan areas in the UK, it is rife with ostentatious surveillance.
What I’m most afraid of is that if we get a significant bombing in the Netherlands, that will be the only excuse necessary to implement these random searches and violations of our civil liberties on Dutch soil. And the populace will swallow it wholesale supported by our MSM ((Formerly a fascist collaborating publication, currently the most popular and most populist newspaper in the Netherlands.)).

    <p>It’s nice to have friends who are pushing their bounds photographically to try and improve their skill and to see them improve leaps and bounds as a result of that.
One such friend is Mony and during his yearly holiday ((Or should I say pilgrimage.)) to Bulgaria he has produced a very nice set of street photography out of Sofia: Picture by Mony Nedkov from the set Sofia.
For me it’s of particular interest to see pictures of a city neighboring my love Istanbul. I have just this one picture I would call a good street photography shot. The effort it takes to get even halfway decent shots is staggering.

    <p>My friendly neighborhood night store will gladly give me a plastic bag for every item of shopping I buy from them ((As well they should if you see the markup they’re charging.)). This is pretty thoughtful and at the same time also pretty short-sighted. Now there seem to be some places in the world that have banned plastic bags though I’m not sure which ones. It is a pretty contentious issue. It seems to be difficult or something but it’s not exactly clear why that is. We’re one of the technically most advanced societies in the world and we can’t live without plastic bags?

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Barack’s visit to Europe again makes clear how important it is to people over here who exactly is the POTUS. A lot of people in Europe are interested and invested in American politics and for good reason if you see the effect the American’s actions can have on the rest of the world.
Polls show that Europeans overwhelmingly support Barack Obama and would like to see him in office as opposed to McCain. This makes it extra annoying that our power to influence the process is severely limited. American elections are in a large part dominated by money and the raising of it. Unfortunately non-Americans are excluded from making donations. Something about foreigners not being allowed to elect the American President.

I had prepared a bit for the day by listening to the photographers’ commentaries on their pictures. As is the case with many artists, the artist should not try to explain his art but in some cases the commentary really adds a lot to the picture.

I’m currently pairing it with my old Logitech MX500 mouse but that is bound to go wireless as well.

    <p>I’ve been tremendously enjoying the stuff Jan Chipchase writes on his blog both current and digging deep into his archives ((Back to a time when comments were still allowed on his blog.)). A dream job if ever there was one.
His current piece is especially pertinent as the iPhone 3G release with builtin GPS and accompanied unlimited data plans will herald the location based revolution. Many of my friends say that they do not want to broadcast where they are and know where their friends are most of the time. That they would rather get together using premediated consensual communication.
