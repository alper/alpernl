    <p>I’m sitting here at Beijing Airport writing these too late weeknotes on their free WiFi ((Also: it is nice to still have a blog in a country where most social services are effectively a SPOF.)) which is an oddly implemented but still excellent service.
Last week was mostly spent with a scattered brain working on my ignite an various proposals. We had a studio meeting at Praxis to discuss recent developments and issues.

    <p>Last week I presented at the Berlin Ignite. I had been present at the last one and greatly enjoyed, so I looked what I could add to the mix.
I threw most of the thinking in the studios for the past 1-2 years on the floor with post-its and distilled the pertinent threads from that. As it happens ‘New Games for New Cities’ was the title of a presentation Kars gave some time ago to which I had contributed but had forgotten about.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Just to start a series here about ways in which German society could be organized more sensibly ((Paraphrasing Harry Potter from the Methods of Rationality: “I don’t want to rule the universe. I just think it could be more sensibly organised.”)) ((Also I need to document this somewhere to get it out of my head.)).
When we switched to the euro in the Netherlands I hardly ever remember seeing the one and two cent coins. I think they were there in the beginning, but popular consensus soon decided that those were too small money amounts to justify bothering with and dispensed with them. They are still legal tender so occasionally you will be given change in those coins at some odd shop in the outback. Everybody knows though that people who do that are douchebags.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Yesterday we went to see Werner Herzog read from his own work in ‘Erroberung des Nutzlosen’ at the Volksbühne. While an impressive display of authorship my enjoyment of the performance was hampered by me having no knowledge of his movies and a recent aversion towards the theater.
With some heavy German, Herzog reads his diary notes from the production of Fitzcarraldo (trailer below), a massive undertaking to make a movie of a massive undertaking. The whole protracted shooting in the jungle sounds a lot like how Apocalypse Now was made.

    <p>Last Saturday I made it out to the penultimate day of the exhibition of the Selim Varol Collection in the me collectors room here in Berlin. I’m glad I did. This was one of the most complete and stunning collections of contemporary toys and subversive art on display anywhere.
Most of the fun is in the sheer completionism of certain walls and cabinets. Acquiring everything past the point of simple fun. Add to that trying to recognize what everything is about, what the references and twists in the various works are.

Brief weeknotes for last week: closed off Pig Chase with the prototype test in the stables. I got to start building a playable prototype for sake, more on that later.
A large part of the rest of the week I spent in various states of bureaucracy trying to get everything in order to be able to request a visa for China. I think I’ve spent about as much time getting the requested papers as I will be in Beijing proper.

    <p>I recently discovered the fan fiction Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by the esteemed Eliezer Yudkowsky (I used to read his friendly AI stuff back in the day) and having never read any Harry Potter ((I watched the movies.)) I still immensely enjoyed this.
In science our powers wax by the year.
I don’t want to rule the universe. I just think it could be more sensibly organised.
Star Wars was the only universe in which the answer actually was that you were supposed to cut yourself off completely from negative emotions

    <p>I read this pamphlet (at Gutenberg) by Thomas Paine a while back on a mountain. However short it may be it packs a massive punch and is brimful with powerful rhetoric. It also contains a rather definitive argument against monarchy. Highly recommended.
First, Because it tends to the decrease and reproach of all religion whatever, and is of the utmost danger to society to make it a party in political disputes.
And the very publishing it proves, that either, ye do not believe what ye profess, or have not virtue enough to practise what ye believe.

Monday I was given a Clever coffee maker and a Hario grinder to be able to make slow coffees at the office. Thanks Kars and Lea for being so attentive.
