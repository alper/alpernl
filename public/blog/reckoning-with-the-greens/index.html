      <article class="mt-6 w-full max-w-4xl lg:max-w-5xl prose prose-slate dark:prose-invert prose-quoteless post-content">
        <p>After some occasional brushes with party politics and reading up on the minimal political agency that we foreigners get here, I dove in. The rise of right-wing sentiment seemed to be a good reason to become a member of the Greens just like I imagine it did for a number of people. Much good that did do if you see the continued rise of that sentiment and this Green government all but enabling right-wing parties with their politics of austerity.</p>
<p>I rescinded my Green Party membership a couple of months ago because of irreconcilable disagreements with their politics. Also because I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re effective even at the things they want to do. That move put me way ahead of the Green youth wings many of whom recently exited the party for similar reasons and with a lot of fanfare.</p>
<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
<p>A lot of my beef with the Greens (though by no means all of it) is for their hypocrisy when it comes to the Palestine question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have a stake in the Israel-Palestine conflict. I know more Israelis than Palestinians and get along with them fine. I&rsquo;m opposed against theocratic movements and governments of all backgrounds. Still, in this conflict it is obviously apparent what is right and what is wrong and it has been obvious for decades.</p>
<p>This topic is too big to treat in whole and I hope there will be hundreds of reckonings of the past year in German politics at some point. I&rsquo;ll just post my receipts and explain why they made the Green Party morally repugnant to me.</p>
<h3 id="cem-özdemir">Cem Özdemir</h3>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/m3o2kD3sy5E?si=4VohITr4yJbTawwB&amp;t=2669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/m3o2kD3sy5E?si=4VohITr4yJbTawwB&t=2669</a>
</p>
<p>Özdemir quotes Golda Meir at an Israel Solidarity event</p>
<p>I saw Özdemir in this video with many other high ranking German politicians quote Golda Meir saying: &ldquo;Peace will come when the Arabs will love their children more than they hate us.&rdquo; This is a vile bit of racism that should be unacceptable but to which nobody batted an eye back then.</p>
<p>Özdemir now is the mostly useless minister for agriculture in this Green government and his political views have not improved.</p>
<h3 id="baerbock">Baerbock</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Strack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://twitter.com/Strack</a>
_C/status/1735629355668173297</p>
<p>Baerbock sat here next to the person responsible for spreading IDF propaganda in Germany which you can understand consists mostly of lies and excuses for war crimes. Her fans will make lots of excuses for this but the optics of being this chummy with such a vile human being do not become any less terrible.</p>
<p>Baerbock now is the foreign minister in the current German government where her already questionable and empty platform of &ldquo;feminist foreign policy&rdquo; has devolved to the point where she is making passionate pleas in favour of war crimes in German parliament.</p>

</p>
<p>The Green parliamentary fraction invited and posed with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danielryanspaulding?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Ryan Spaulding</a>
, a comedian who&rsquo;s made a name for himself now with increasingly racist anti-Palestinian bits.</p>
<h3 id="habeck">Habeck</h3>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/-JfiOOuXG2Y?si=pU5LXRncsFyWAr9w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/-JfiOOuXG2Y?si=pU5LXRncsFyWAr9w</a>
</p>
<p>Habeck, the only functional politician in the German government, posted this sermon relatively quickly after the attacks. It has been much praised by mainstream Germany but every Palestinian and Arab listening to it will hear: &ldquo;You are second class citizens. Your grievances are not real. You do not belong here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think back then it was smart to put out a message alienating a sizeable minority in your country. I think I&rsquo;ve been proven right.</p>
<h2 id="party">Party</h2>
<p>What the of the Green Party members themselves?</p>
<p>Inside the party itself on this topic I&rsquo;ve seen mostly silence and a significant number of statements that would not be out of place in the AfD.</p>
<p>The Green youth wings who left the party did so because of (valid) political disagreements with the party establishment but none of them even once mentioned Palestine in the exit statements.</p>
<h2 id="party-membership">Party Membership</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think party membership is a thing for most people. There are power dynamics at play which are the same in the Greens as they are everywhere else. In every party there are two classes of members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Career politicians who have decades of experience and relationships in the party. They run everything.</li>
<li>Ordinary members who are there to volunteer at the local levels and support the party materially with their time or money.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two classes have almost no interaction with each other. The mechanisms of inner party democracy (and pretty much any functional organisation) are setup in such a way that ordinary members can&rsquo;t bother the people doing the &ldquo;actual work&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So what is the point of being a member if you don&rsquo;t have time or money to give?</p>
<p>I would answer that <em>for me</em> there is no point in party membership. I don&rsquo;t get anything out of it. I may keep voting for the Greens (for lack of better alternatives) and support them in one way or another, but I don&rsquo;t need to be a member to do either of those things.</p>
<p>Maybe being a party member will be worth it for others who have more to give or who stand to get more out of it. That is a calculation that everybody needs to make for themselves.</p>
