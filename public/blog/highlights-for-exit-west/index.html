<p>but that is the way of things, with cities as with life, for one moment we are pottering about our errands as usual and the next we are dying, and our eternally impending ending does not put a stop to our transient beginnings and middles until the instant when it does.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Location, location, location, the realtors say. Geography is destiny, respond the historians.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They had begun, each of them, to be penetrated, but they had not yet kissed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for he was so gentle, and evoked in her a protective caring, as if for one’s own child, or for a puppy, or for a beautiful memory one knows has already commenced to fade.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and he did not wish to do this, he preferred to abide, in a sense, in the past, for the past offered more to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and so by making the promise he demanded she make she was in a sense killing him, but that is the way of things, for when we migrate, we murder from our lives those we leave behind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>who had run from war already, and did not know where next to run, and so were waiting, waiting, like so many others.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even more than the fighter planes and the tanks these robots, few though they were, and the drones overhead, were frightening, because they suggested an unstoppable efficiency, an inhuman power, and evoked the kind of dread that a small mammal feels before a predator of an altogether different order, like a rodent before a snake.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cutting across divisions of race or language or nation, for what did those divisions matter now in a world full of doors,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The news in those days was full of war and migrants and nativists, and it was full of fracturing too, of regions pulling away from nations, and cities pulling away from hinterlands, and it seemed that as everyone was coming together everyone was also moving apart.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Millions arrived in our country,”Saeed replied. “When there were wars nearby.”</p>
<p>“That was different. Our country was poor. We didn’t feel we had as much to lose.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To flee forever is beyond the capacity of most: at some point even a hunted animal will stop, exhausted, and await its fate, if only for a while.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps they had decided they did not have it in them to do what would have needed to be done, to corral and bloody and where necessary slaughter the migrants, and had determined that some other way would have to be found.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In exchange for their labor in clearing terrain and building infrastructure and assembling dwellings from prefabricated blocks, migrants were promised forty meters and a pipe: a home on forty square meters of land and a connection to all the utilities of modernity.</p>
<p>A mutually agreed time tax had been enacted, such that a portion of the income and toil of those who had recently arrived on the island would go to those who had been there for decades, and this time tax was tapered in both directions, becoming a smaller and smaller sliver as one continued to reside, and then a larger and larger subsidy thereafter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He was drawn to people from their country, both in the labor camp and online. It seemed to Nadia that the farther they moved from the city of their birth, through space and through time, the more he sought to strengthen his connection to it, tying ropes to the air of an era that for her was unambiguously gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But in his devotions was ever more devotion, and towards her it seemed there was ever less.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It seemed to Saeed that the people who advocated this position most strongly, who claimed the rights of nativeness most forcefully, tended to be drawn from the ranks of those with light skin who looked most like the natives of Britain—and as had been the case with many of the natives of Britain, many of these people too seemed stunned by what was happening to their homeland, what had already happened in so brief a period, and some seemed angry as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and prayer for him became about being a man, being one of the men, a ritual that connected him to adulthood and to the notion of being a particular sort of man, a gentleman, a gentle man, a man who stood for community and faith and kindness and decency, a man, in other words, like his father. Young men pray for different things, of course, but some young men pray to honor the goodness of the men who raised them, and Saeed was very much a young man of this mold.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and so even though they spoke less and did less together, they saw each other more, although not more often.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of this, in later years, both were glad, and both would also wonder if this meant that they had made a mistake, that if they had but waited and watched their relationship would have flowered again, and so their memories took on potential, which is of course how our greatest nostalgias are born.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been said that depression is a failure to imagine a plausible desirable future for oneself, and, not just in Marin, but in the whole region, in the Bay Area, and in many other places too, places both near and far, the apocalypse appeared to have arrived and yet it was not apocalyptic, which is to say that while the changes were jarring they were not the end, and life went on, and people found things to do and ways to be and people to be with, and plausible desirable futures began to emerge, unimaginable previously, but not unimaginable now, and the result was something not unlike relief.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How this assembly would coexist with other preexisting bodies of government was as yet undecided. It might at first have only a moral authority, but that authority could be substantial, for unlike those other entities for which some humans were not human enough to exercise suffrage, this new assembly would speak from the will of all the people, and in the face of that will, it was hoped, greater justice might be less easily denied.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the lives of cities being far more persistent and more gently cyclical than those of people</p>
