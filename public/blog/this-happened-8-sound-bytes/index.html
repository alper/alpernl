<p>They had the need but they couldn&rsquo;t really interact with each other.</p>

<p>They should be able to show off to others what they can do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There were people falling asleep and during our user test only one person fell asleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What you can provide is some fun during the day, that they&rsquo;re not just sitting there and staring.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even when the phone is ringing the caregiver has to direct them what to do.</p>

<p>The caretakers really like to have more control.</p>

<h3 id="rainer">Rainer</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The term generative has been used too broad lately.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually when you talk about generative methods, they result in visual complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I could talk about my interest in noise for hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I always use random parameters and noise functions that transform my images.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After we got commissioned we found out that the opening of the room was in two weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This emerged from the idea that we wanted to work with the architecture in the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At first sight it&rsquo;s not clear what&rsquo;s projected and what&rsquo;s fixed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Somehow it always resulted in noisy visuals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I started to bring back the analog aesthetic.</p>

<h3 id="lotte">Lotte</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I was working in New York and I was mildly bored.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t very attractive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ask her to make a Wordpress skin.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We just had all this content on the site and we needed a place to put it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t there periods? They said: yeah there are periods.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Minor details but really part of the process of figuring out where you&rsquo;re going.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I did all this in Illustrator because I didn&rsquo;t know there were other tools to do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wanted to find a visual way of dragging people in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to provide an alternative to the really expensive art history books.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you send out a survey you never get good answers.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re just five art historians and an information architect.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also my first keynote so I went a bit overboard with the transitions.</p>

<p>They really try to make the most of exposing themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We decided to visit the location. This was very good.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re standing there and you see the area, you really see the potential of the area.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would be really absurd.</p>

<p>There were all these connotations of playfulness from your childhood.</p>

<p>We modeled it using lego. It has nice affordances.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a man staring at something he built with his own hands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if his face is about to break from smiling so hard.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t imagine that two people wanted to sit on the thing at the same time. Which was quite erotic actually.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Two girls one chick.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There were definitely people coming back for more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Twitter I was reading: I think I broke my arm. It&rsquo;s quite a strenuous exercise.</p>
