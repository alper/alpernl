        <blockquote>
<p>The days are long but the years are short.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One more year over and these are starting to look like a blur, so here&rsquo;s what changed.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I gave notice between Christmas and New Year 2020 and spent the first three months of the year in a weird in-between state mostly done with the old job, waiting for the new one to start, in between daycare closures and being sick.</p>
<p>Then the new job started and I fell into a blur of work that has continued for most of the rest of the year. It&rsquo;s been a nice change but also very intense. Details are on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/alper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been anywhere in 2021 except to an island in Croatia last September with work which definitely was a highlight.</p>
<p>Will I travel again and why? I have no idea.</p>
<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>
<p><a href="/dingen/2021/09/leveled-up-in-turkish/">I finished Turkish.</a>
 I now prefer it over German again especially for writing.</p>
<p>I gave up on Chinese and couldn&rsquo;t motivate myself or figure out how to book the HSK2. I did learn a couple hundred characters which seem to mean the same thing as in Japanese.</p>
<p>I started learning Japanese which is a lot more enjoyable and for basic conversation seems a lot easier. There also has been some <a href="/dingen/2021/11/16644/">strengthening on the claim</a>
 for a relationship between Turkish and Japanese so let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<p>I should have started this way earlier and not listened to anybody who ever said something is difficult. What they mean is that something was difficult <em>for them</em>. Depending on their intelligence, many things may in fact be difficult <em>for them</em>. It shouldn&rsquo;t matter to me or anybody else.</p>
<h2 id="kids">Kids</h2>
<p>The daycare was closed at the start of the year until March or Easter, not sure anymore. Most of the rest of the year things were up and running.</p>
<p>We had a nasty burn wound on one kid that cut the summer break short and gave us several weeks of grief but in the end all turned out well.</p>
<p>Then at the end of the year we gave notice. We are leaving one very esteemed Kindergarten for another which I didn&rsquo;t think would be possible with two kids in the middle of the year, but it is. We even had several more places willing to take our kids.</p>
<p>The kids are doing really well. After a brief bout of gymnastics which they enjoyed a lot, COVID made us switch to outdoor ice skating for now.</p>
<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>
<p>I finally killed my old fixie or to be more correct it nearly killed me. With it gone, I could finally shop for a real road bike.</p>
<p>Thanks to a ship blocking the Suez Canal and all the other supply chain difficulties in the world, there was a tremendous bike shortage most of the summer (who knows, maybe it&rsquo;s still going on?) and I got any random bike I could get my hands on in the €1000 price range.</p>
<p>I also got most of the tools and kit that you would need for cycling. It&rsquo;s the clichéed guy midlife hobby. The local Rapha store is more convenient and also cheaper than many of the cycling apparel you can buy dropshipped over Instagram.</p>
<p>I seem to have ridden 1231km on it and looking forward to doing many times that in the coming year. The details are on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/3476127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strava</a>
.</p>
<p>I picked up bouldering again which when in a rhythm (every 4-5 days) I&rsquo;m finding pretty enjoyable.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<p>I got boosted randomly on November 17th which was a lot earlier than I expected and before almost everybody I know. I am now AZ/Comirnaty/Comirnaty.</p>
<p>We survived another year. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the year note.</p>
