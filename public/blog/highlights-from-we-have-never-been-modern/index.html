        <blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let us not mix up heaven and earth</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In works produced by anthropologists abroad, you will not find a single trait that is not simultaneously real, social and narrated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ethnologist will certainly not write three separate books: one dealing with knowledge, another with power, yet another with practices.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the representation of nonhumans belongs to science, but science is not allowed to appeal to politics; the representation of citizens belongs to politics, but politics is not allowed to have any relation to the nonhumans produced and mobilized by science and technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hobbes’s and Boyle’s followers succeeded in carrying out this task — the former by ridding Nature of any divine presence, the latter by ridding Society of any divine origin.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By playing three times in a row on the same alternation between transcendence and immanence, the moderns can mobilize Nature, objectify the social, and feel the spiritual presence of God, even while firmly maintaining that Nature escapes us, that Society is our own work, and that God no longer intervenes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The critical power of the moderns lies in this double language: they can mobilize Nature at the heart of social relationships, even as they leave Nature infinitely remote from human beings; they are free to make and unmake their society, even as they render its laws ineluctable, necessary and absolute.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By separating the relations of political power from the relations of scientific reasoning while continuing to shore up power with reason and reason with power, the moderns have always had two irons in the fire. They have become invincible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the impossibility of changing the social order without modifying the natural order — and vice versa — that has obliged the premoderns to exercise the greatest prudence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By rendering mixtures unthinkable, by emptying, sweeping, cleaning and purifying the arena that is opened in the central space defined by their three sources of power, the moderns allowed the practice of mediation to recombine all possible monsters without letting them have any effect on the social fabric, or even any contact with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Seen as networks, however, the modern world, like revolutions, permits scarcely anything more than small extensions of practices, slight accelerations in the circulation of knowledge, a tiny extension of societies, minuscule increases in the number of actors, small modifications of old beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With the postmoderns, the abandonment of the modern project is consummated. I have not found words ugly enough to designate this intellectual movement — or rather, this intellectual immobility through which humans and nonhumans are left to drift.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A single modern example will illustrate the abdication of thought as well as the self-inflicted defeat of the postmodern project.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the double contradiction that is modern, the contradiction between the two constitutional guarantees of Nature and Society on the one hand, and between the practice of purification and the practice of mediation on the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is only one positive thing to be said about the postmoderns: after them, there is nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They are simply stuck in the impasse of all avant-gardes that have no more troops behind them. Let them sleep till the end of the millennium, as Baudrillard advocates, and let us move on to other things. Or rather, let us retrace our steps. Let us stop moving on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As Lévi-Strauss says, ‘the barbarian is first and foremost the man who believes in barbarism.’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature and Society are no longer explanatory terms but rather something that requires a conjoined explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to gain access to things themselves, not only to their phenomena. The real is not remote; rather, it is accessible in all the objects mobilized throughout the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The collectives we live in are more active, more productive, more socialized than the tiresome things-in-themselves led us to expect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our collectives are more real, more naturalized, more discursive than the tiresome humans-among-themselves led us to expect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Real as Nature, narrated as Discourse, collective as Society, existential as Being: such are the quasi-objects that the moderns have caused to proliferate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything changes if the staunch discipline of the principle of symmetry forces us to retain only the causes that could serve both truth and falsehood, belief and knowledge, science and parascience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Marc Augé when he resided among the lagoon-dwellers of the Ivory Coast, sought to understand the entire social phenomenon revealed by sorcery</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A symmetrical Marc Augé would have studied the sociotechnological network of the metro itself: its engineers as well as its drivers, its directors and its clients, the employer-State, the whole shebang — simply doing at home what he had always done elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Western ethnologists cannot limit themselves to the periphery; otherwise, still asymmetrical, they would show boldness toward others, timidity toward themselves. Back home anthropology need not become the marginal discipline of the margins, picking up the crumbs that fall from the other disciplines’ banquet table.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Her tribe of scientists claims that in the end they are completely separating their knowledge of the world from the necessities of politics and morality (Traweek, 1988). In the observer’s eyes, however, this separation is never very visible, or is itself only the byproduct of a much more mixed activity, some tinkering in and out of the laboratory. Her informers claim that they have access to Nature, but the ethnographer sees perfectly well that they have access only to a vision, a representation of Nature that she herself cannot distinguish neatly from politics and social interests (Pickering, 1980). This tribe, like the earlier one, projects its own social categories on to Nature; what is new is that it pretends it has not done so. When the ethnologist explains to her informers that they cannot separate Nature from the social representation they have formed of it, they are scandalized or nonplussed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the stance that makes it possible to respect the differences (the dimensions of the helixes do vary) while at the same time respecting the similarities (all collectives mix human and nonhuman entities together in the same way).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern knowledge and power are different not in that they would escape at last the tyranny of the social, but in that they add many more hybrids in order to recompose the social link and extend its scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, science is indeed politics pursued by other means, means that are powerful only because they remain radically other (Latour, 1990b).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is, by itself, either reducible or irreducible to anything else. Never by itself, but always through the mediation of another.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The past was a barbarian medley; the future, a civilizing distinction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But before long they will have achieved modernization, they will have liquidated those islands, and we shall all inhabit the same planet; we shall all be equally modern, all equally capable of profiting from what, alone, forever escapes the tyranny of social interest: economic rationality, scientific truth, technological efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Having been slapped in the face with modern reality, poor populations now have to submit to postmodern hyperreality. Nothing has value; everything is a reflection, a simulacrum, a floating sign; and that very weakness, they say, may save us from the invasion of technologies, sciences, reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The moderns’ greatness stems from their proliferation of hybrids, their lengthening of a certain type of network, their acceleration of the production of traces, their multiplication of delegates, their groping production of relative universals. Their daring, their research, their innovativeness, their tinkering, their youthful excesses, the ever-increasing scale of their action, the creation of stabilized objects independent of society, the freedom of a society liberated from objects — all these are features we want to keep.</p>
