I tried 750 words , but I&rsquo;d like my writing efforts to be viewed by a larger public and be of some use. Weeknotes for me could solve the problem of recapping what it was I actually did in a week (and also show other people what it is I actually do).
Monday I wrote an overview of the first chapter of Check in / Check out. That got picked up by Adam Greenfield the following day by the miracle of trackbacks and Google Translate. Good as well, because I need to do some prepwork on Transmobility before meeting with people from 9292ov next week.

<p>I wrote <a href="/dingen/2010/06/check-in-check-out-case-by-case-%E2%80%94-case-0001-%E2%80%9Cpasjes-en-poortjes%E2%80%9D/">an overview of the first chapter</a>

 the following day by the miracle of trackbacks and Google Translate. Good as well, because I need to do some prepwork on Transmobility before meeting with people from 9292ov next week.</p>
<p>Check in / Check out has a series of design principles at the end of each chapter. Those might be interesting to a wider audience, so I&rsquo;m going to translate those to English.</p>
<p>I finished a presentation on two transportation concepts for Amsterdam, both involving water. Still waiting to hear back from my city council member, but that may be publishable in the near future.</p>
<p>I went to a meeting on <a href="http://www.wibautaandeamstel.nl/projecten/amstelstation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the future of the Amstel station</a>
 next to my house. Here&rsquo;s a picture of their bold plans where I most probably won&rsquo;t be living anymore by the time they are completed:

<h3 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h3>
<p>Tuesday was the real start of project Ebi more on which <a href="http://leapfrog.nl/blog/archives/2010/06/25/week-155-156/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at Leapfroglog</a>
.</p>
<p>We managed to cover quite some ground, but because of the plurality of our options, the creative process can be quite devastating draining.</p>
<p>I unfortunately missed the Amsterdam.js meetup, but I&rsquo;m happy that the AMS programming scene is reactivating.</p>
<h3 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h3>
<p>The good start of Ebi (and its subsequent celebrations took their toll). After a slow start at Stumptown —where I may be found regularly on weekday mornings— I got to the office where I was stuck till 22:00 because of the slowness of the iOS4 update.</p>
<p>Did some work on <em>puebla</em> which is a low data but heavy content dataviz to be published in the near future.</p>
<p>Also published <a href="/dingen/2010/06/ux-triangle/">the UX Triangle</a>
 a funnily accurate model of the UX community.</p>
<h3 id="thursday">Thursday</h3>
<p>The rest of the week wasn&rsquo;t that productive due to a touch of flu. Did some more work on Ebi.</p>
<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>
<p>More work on Ebi (designs of which by the way are coming along and are ridiculously awesome).</p>
<p>In the afternoon I had a studio day with <a href="http://www.mediamatic.net/person/3347/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dirk van Oosterbosch</a>
 at his Damrak studio. We discussed progress on the Table Viewer and another more commercial but innovative HTML5 project.</p>
<p>Then it was off to the <a href="http://www.cineville.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cineville</a>
 launch party. Cineville is an all-you-can-eat movie pass for 13 Amsterdam art house cinemas. They recently redeveloped their site to become a hub for the pass, the cinemas and everything to do with indie movies in Amsterdam (eventually to become a sort of Last.fm for the cinematic experience). I beta tested the release (rather enthusiastically) and was curious to their future plans.</p>
<h3 id="saturday">Saturday</h3>
<p>Nothing much except a good coffee (at Stumptown again!) and professional discussion with <a href="http://twitter.com/tacoe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taco</a>
.</p>
<h3 id="sunday">Sunday</h3>
<p>More work on Ebi. The site is mostly functional now in Django but I&rsquo;ve also read up on both <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MongoDB</a>
 and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REDIS</a>
 because of the inherent flexibility requirements of a project such as this one.</p>
<p>Somewhere this week I also started to read <a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2009/01/designing_for_the_digital_age.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Designing for the Digital Age</a>
 which is the next book for our <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;gid=1795982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UX Book Club</a>
 —now with <a href="http://twitter.com/uxbcams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter account</a>
— and is promising to be quite the read.</p>
<p>That was about it. Now I&rsquo;m off for a more than overdue BBQ on the beach.</p>
