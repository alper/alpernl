<p>The big screen is back home because we have emptied our office in Berlin and are awaiting the new one. The biggest impediment to me getting a console in fact was the fact that we didn&rsquo;t have any screens at home and buying a console would mean having to get a tv/projector as well.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://badcrane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markus Kaikkonen</a>
 agreed to hook me up with his old Playstation 3 since he had just gotten a PS4 and was going to play some stuff on that over the holidays anyway. Many thanks to Markus for that and I do agree that it can&rsquo;t hurt to play a bunch of these games but now that I have nearly two dozen of them (thanks also <a href="https://twitter.com/peterbihr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Bihr</a>
 and <a href="https://twitter.com/firepunchd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simon Cubasch</a>
) to go through it does feel a bit like work. I will post my findings here.</p>
<p>Somme preliminary stuff that isn&rsquo;t very game specific:</p>
<p>Console games are a huge deal. This may seem obvious but I hadn&rsquo;t fully realized it before. I think it is fair to say that most males below the age of 40 own a console, owned one or have wanted to own one in the past decade. Being a contender in the console wars and releasing AAA games have huge entry costs but they also carry with them the potential for gigantic upsides.</p>
<p>I had noted the fact that there weren&rsquo;t any good action franchises anymore. The only stuff we get are Bond movies and a Bourne episode every five years or so. I am now wagering that most of the audience and the budgets for these things have gone into AAA shooters. A FPS game is more fun, about as poorly written and more cost effective (for the consumer) than going to the cinema for a similar ‘shoot stuff and blow stuff up’ experience. For the same price as a current AAA game you can go to the movies 3-4 times.</p>
<p>I am surprised at the amount of grinding in AAA games. Playing parts of a game over and over again because of poor design or balancing. Especially egregious are situations where every death means a lengthy reload and resumes you somewhere back before. Also I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time in geometric first or third person games walking around looking for the clue to the next stage. They may have higher production values than mobile games but the amount of grinding seems to be about the same.</p>
