        <blockquote>
<p>it might have been only a temporary confluence of interests, but everything was temporary now— with so many traditions broken or vanished, it left what John used to call the necessity of creation;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They were apolitical, supposedly, like civil servants— empiricists, who only wanted things managed in a rational scientific style, the greatest good for the greatest number, which ought to be fairly simple to arrange, if people were not so trapped in emotions, religions, governments, and other mass delusional systems of that sort.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the adepts, the walk from Sabishii up onto the massif must have been an aesthetic journey, filled with allusions and subtle variants of tradition that were invisible to him. Hiroko would have called it areoformation, or the areophany.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To see the landscape in its history, to read it like a text, written by its own long past;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Less obviously visionary, perhaps, less spectacular, less active; an acceptance of what was there; love of rock, for rock’s sake. For Mars’s sake.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That must be why they’re killing each other— they know what they’re thinking themselves, and so they suspect all the others. How ugly. How sad.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The so-called risk of the capitalist is merely one of the privileges of capital.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You don’t know about this partly because you are ignorant, and partly because metanationalism itself steadfastly ignored and denied all alternatives to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And justice and freedom do not contradict each other as much as has been claimed, because freedom in an injust system is no freedom at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In your mental traveling you can journey back into the past, retrace your steps, see where you turned and why, then proceed onward in a direction that is different because it includes these loops of understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was power politics and hierarchy to these people now, they had forgotten the real issues involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What mattered to them was not the result of any single disagreement, but the successful use of the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course her reading of Bogdanovism was relatively simple: things should be just, Arkady had insisted, and everyone free and equal; the past didn’t matter; they needed to invent new forms whenever the old ones looked unfair or impractical, which was often; Mars was the only reality that counted, at least to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She was a power; and people knew it; and power was corrosive. Power was powerful, in more ways than one.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If millions and millions of Terrans began to pour up onto Mars, they all argued, what then of Mars— not just of the landscape itself, but of the Martian culture that had been forming over the m-years? Wouldn’t that be drowned in the old ways brought up by the new influx, which might quickly outnumber the native population?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a lot of time to fill. And the only work really interesting enough to pursue over the long haul would be raising a kid, don’t you think?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was hard to give up being a revolutionary. Nothing seemed to follow from it, either logically or emotionally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in an expanding universe, Spencer had said, order was not really order, but merely the difference between the actual entropy exhibited and the maximum entropy possible. This difference was what humans perceived as order.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“And the land is in the shared stewardship of everyone. We still own personal items as property, but land as property has never happened here. That’s a new social reality, we struggle with it every day.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What now was lacking? Peace of mind? Nanao would have laughed. The presence of other old friends? Well, there would be other days for that. Now, in this moment, they were two old brothers in arms, sitting on a sea cliff. After all the years of struggle they could sit out there all afternoon if they liked, flying a kite and talking. Discussing their old friends and the weather. There had been trouble before, there would be trouble again; but here they were.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And as the process continued, and a hundred and then a thousand asteroids and moonlets were given a local habitation and a name, the process took fire, becoming what some called the explosive diaspora, others simply the accelerando.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People now ordinarily understood capitalism to have been the clash of feudalism and democracy, and the present to be the democratic age, the clash of capitalism and harmony.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this pressured situation, history was little comfort; so far they had dealt with it well, but never before had humanity responded to a crisis of need with any longterm consistent sensible sanity; mass madness had erupted before; and they were the exact same animals that in previous centuries, faced with matters of subsistence and survival, had slaughtered each other indiscriminately.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They did not fully understand that patriarchy no longer mattered, and perhaps never had— that it had always been caught in the Kegel grip of uterine law, which operated outside patriarchy with a biological power that could not be controlled by any mere politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s like a rainbow. Without an observer at a twenty-three-degree angle to the light reflecting off a cloud of spherical droplets, there is no rainbow. The whole universe is like that. Our spirits stand at a twenty-three-degree angle to the universe. There is some new thing created at the contact of photon and retina, some space created between rock and mind. Without mind there is no intrinsic worth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Chinese are still jammed into their country like sardines, and they don’t give a damn about the intrinsic worth of China itself, much less a barren moonlet on the edge of the solar system.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You can try sabotage like the Reds did on Mars, but they can blow you off the moons here just as easy as you can them, and they’ve got a million replacements for every colonist they lose.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Their attitude was deeply hypocritical, as most of those applauding made their living from Terran tourists, and all of them were immigrants or the children of immigrants; but they cheered anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And so the newcomers can’t cope. They cluster in immigrant ghettos, or new towns entire, and keep their traditions and their ties to home, and hate everything here, and all the xenophobia and misogyny in those old cultures breaks out again, against both their own women and the native girls.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve tried to integrate newcomers every way we know, but they clump, naturally, and you can’t just break them up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But so many problems are rising— cases of sharia, family abuse, ethnic gangs getting in fights, immigrants attacking natives— usually men attacking women, but not always. And young native gangs are retaliating, harassing the new settlements and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mars right now is the battleground of past and future, and the past has its power, but the future is where we’re all going. There’s a kind of inexorable power in it, like a vacuum pull forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Science was a social construct, but it was also and most importantly its own space, conforming to reality only; that was its beauty</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If nothing was real but this moment, Planck instant after Planck instant, an unimaginably thin membrane of becoming between past and future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People in the streets, that’s the only thing governments are afraid of. Well, or term limits. Or free elections! Or assassination. Or being laughed at, ah, ha-ha-ha!</p>
</blockquote>
