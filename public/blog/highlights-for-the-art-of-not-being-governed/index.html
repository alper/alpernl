<p>This is the history of those who got away</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the power of the state to deploy distance-demolishing technologies—railroads, all-weather roads, telephone, telegraph, airpower, helicopters, and now information technology—so changed the strategic balance of power between self-governing peoples and nation-states, so diminished the friction of terrain, that my analysis largely ceases to be useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, living in the absence of state structures has been the standard human condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That frontier operated as a rough and ready homeostatic device; the more a state pressed its subjects, the fewer subjects it had.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Seen from the state center, this enclosure movement is, in part, an effort to integrate and monetize the people, lands, and resources of the periphery so that they become, to use the French term, rentable—auditable contributors to the gross national product and to foreign exchange.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More commonly, nonstate peoples found it convenient to raid the settlements of sedentary farming communities subject to the state, sometimes exacting systematic tribute from them in the manner of states.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The main, long-run threat of the ungoverned periphery, however, was that it represented a constant temptation, a constant alternative to life within the state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For long periods people moved in and out of states, and “stateness”was, itself, often cyclical and reversible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the periphery of states became a zone of refuge or “shatter zone,”where the human shards of state formation and rivalry accumulated willy nilly, creating regions of bewildering ethnic and linguistic complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Their subsistence routines, their social organization, their physical dispersal, and many elements of their culture, far from being the archaic traits of a people left behind, are purposefully crafted both to thwart incorporation into nearby states and to minimize the likelihood that statelike concentrations of power will arise among them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They are, in other words, political adaptations of nonstate peoples to a world of states that are, at once, attractive and threatening.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The attempt to bring the periphery into line is read by representatives of the sponsoring state as providing civilization and progress—where progress is, in turn, read as the intrusive propagation of the linguistic, agricultural, and religious practices of the dominant ethnic group:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The principle behind region-making in each case is that, for the premodern world, water, especially if it is calm, joins people, whereas mountains, especially if they are high and rugged, divide people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Zomia is thus knitted together as a region not by a political unity, which it utterly lacks, but by comparable patterns of diverse hill agriculture, dispersal and mobility, and rough egalitarianism, which, not incidentally, includes a relatively higher status for women than in the valleys.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn Khaldun, who noted that “Arabs can gain control only over flat territory”and do not pursue tribes that hide in the mountains.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hill polities are, almost invariably, redistributive, competitive feasting systems held together by the benefits they are able to disburse.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Accounts of lowland states that miss this dimension do not merely “leave out”the hills; they ignore a set of boundary conditions and exchanges that make the center what it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For most of its history, Southeast Asia has been marked by the relative absence even of valley states. Where they arose, they tended to be remarkably short-lived, comparatively weak outside a small and variable radius of the court center, and generally unable systematically to extract resources (including manpower) from a substantial population.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It becomes difficult, in this context, to reconstruct the life-world of nonelites, even if they are located at the court center.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>State rulers find it well nigh impossible to install an effective sovereignty over people who are constantly in motion, who have no permanent pattern of organization, no permanent address, whose leadership is ephemeral, whose subsistence patterns are pliable and fugitive, who have few permanent allegiances, and who are liable, over time, to shift their linguistic practices and their ethnic identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Grain, then, as compared with root crops, is both legible to the state and relatively appropriable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All the evidence points to the piecemeal elaboration of padi lands by kinship units and hamlets that built and extended the small diversion dams, sluices, and channels required for water control. Such irrigation works often predated the creation of state cores and, just as frequently, survived the collapse of many a state that had taken temporary advantage of its concentrated manpower and food supply.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Provisioning the state’s core population with grain ran up against the intractable limits of distance and harvest fluctuations, while the population sequestered to plant that grain found it all too easy to walk beyond the reach of state control.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In thirteenth-century Europe, according to one calculation, shipping costs by sea were a mere 5 percent of the cost by land.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the distance-demolishing technology of railroads and all-weather motor roads, land-bound polities in Southeast Asia and Europe found it extremely difficult, without navigable waterways, to concentrate and then project power.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rulers fed major inland cities such as Berlin and Madrid only at great effort and great cost to their hinterlands. The exceptional efficiency of waterways in the Netherlands undoubtedly gave the Dutch great advantages at peace and war.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They would also, as we shall see, help demarcate the sharp difference between a geography more amenable to state control and appropriation (state space) and a geography intrinsically resistant to state control (nonstate space).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It matters little how wealthy a kingdom is if its potential surplus of manpower and grain is dispersed across a landscape that makes its collection difficult and costly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Less reliant on volatile trade, more hierarchical, more insulated from food-supply crises, and capable of feeding quite massive armies, these agrarian states might lose a battle or even a war, but their staying power over the long haul tended to prevail.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“To have too many people [as subjects to a lord] is better than to have too much grass [uncultivated land].”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Vagrancy was discouraged and displaced people were fixed to a plot of land where they could be turned into reliable sources of taxation, corvée labour and military service.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The expansion and peopling of legible state space was intrinsically difficult, given the open frontier. If it was occasionally achieved, it was due as much to the closing off of alternatives as to the inherent attractions of state space.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Statecraft with both eyes fixed on the accumulation of manpower could hardly be particular about whom it incorporated. A “manpower state”in this sense is, in principle, the enemy of hard and fast cultural distinctions and exclusiveness. Put more accurately, such states had great incentives to incorporate whomever they could and to invent cultural, ethnic, and religious formulas that would allow them to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When it came to skilled manpower as well as foot soldiers and cultivators, the need for their services precluded rigid cultural exclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The manpower imperative was, everywhere, the enemy of discrimination and exclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Slaves, it is fair to say, were the most important “cash crop”of precolonial Southeast Asia: the most sought-after commodity in the region’s commerce. Virtually every large trader was, simultaneously, a slave-raider or a buyer. Every military campaign, every punitive expedition was, at the same time, a campaign for captives who could be bought, sold, or held.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowing this, one might have expected statecraft to consist in sailing as close to the wind as they could: that is, in extracting resources just short of the point at which they would provoke flight or rebellion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Peoples who appeared to have no fixed abode, who moved constantly and unpredictably, were beyond the pale of civilization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, to the degree that irrigated padi cultivation massively alters the landscape, while hill agriculture appears less visually obtrusive, hill peoples came to be associated with nature as against culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, of all the commodities that the hill societies could deny the valleys, their trump card was manpower.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All those who had reason to flee state power—to escape taxes, conscription, disease, poverty, or prison, or to trade or raid—were, in a sense, tribalizing themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What passes, in the eyes of valley officials, as deplorable backwardness may, for those so stigmatized, represent a political space of self-governance, mobility, and freedom from taxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The official invisibility of defection is encoded in the narrative itself; those who move to nonstate space, who adapt to its agro-ecology, become ethnicized barbarians who were, presumably, always there.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Those absorbed disappeared as distinctive societies, though they lent their cultural color to the amalgam that came to represent valley culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This reversal is an important reminder that the key to premodern state-building is the concentration of arable land and manpower, not altitude per se.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Competition among the agrarian states for conscripts led to constant sweeps for “vagrants”—virtually anyone without a fixed residence—to fulfill draconian recruitment quotas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gypsies, the most stigmatized and scourged of the itinerant poor, were criminalized and made the object of the notorious Zegeuner Jagt (Gypsy hunts).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This no-man’s land, this narrow zone of refuge, became known as the “outlaw corridor.”The outlaw corridor was simply a concentration of migrants “between the Palatine and Saxony, which was too far from the Prussian-Brandenburg recruitment area as well as from the Mediterranean (in the latter case, the transportation costs were higher then the price per slave).”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As Hefner observes, the overriding goal of the Tengger uplanders is to avoid “being ordered about”; an aspiration that is deliberately at odds with the elaborate hierarchies and status-coded behavior of the Javanese lowlands.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The varied timing of the many waves of migration, their location by altitude, and their mode of subsistence account, Keesing believes, for the luxuriant diversity of the mountain ethnoscape in contrast to valley uniformity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The hills, from the valley perspective, were associated with heathenism, apostasy, primitive wildness and ferocity, and insubordination.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Having, over time, adapted to a hilly environment and, as we shall see, developed a social structure and subsistence routines to avoid incorporation, they are now seen by their lowland neighbors as impoverished, backward, tribal populations that lacked the talent for civilization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Again and again, the compilers are told that the village was founded recently or several generations back by people who had come from elsewhere, usually to escape war or oppression.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All these options were generally preferred to the risks of open rebellion, an option confined largely to elites contending for the throne.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The expression “states make wars and wars make states,”coined by Charles Tilly</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It mattered little whether the army in question was “one’s own”or that of a neighboring kingdom, the quartermaster’s requirements were the same, and so, largely, was the treatment of civilians and property.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The wet-rice valleys and the level plains of the typical valley state are not merely topographically flat; they can also be thought of as having been culturally, linguistically, and religiously flattened.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When Islam swept the area the Berbers became Muslims, but soon expressed their dissent from the inequalities of Arab Muslim rule by becoming Kharijite heretics.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Religious identity in this case is a self-selected boundary-making device designed to emphasize political and social difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the deadly epidemic diseases from which we suffer—smallpox, flu, tuberculosis, plague, measles, and cholera—are zoonotic diseases that have evolved from domesticated animals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>State-resistant space was therefore not a place on the map but a position vis-Ã -vis power;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A complete accounting of state-resistant places would have as many pages devoted to low, wet places—marshes, swamps, fens, bogs, moors, deltas, mangrove coasts, and complex waterways and archipelagoes—as to high mountain redoubts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Self-marginalization, or “self-barbarianization”in valley terms, might have been, at times, quite common. Civilizational discourse, however, made such conduct unthinkable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dissimilation—not to be confused with dissimulation—refers to the more or less purposeful creation of cultural distance between societies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These communities ranged in size from Palmares in Brazil, with perhaps twenty thousand inhabitants, and Dutch Guiana (Surinam), with that many or more, to smaller settlements of escapees throughout the Caribbean (Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico, Saint-Domingue), as well as in Florida and on the Virginia-North Carolina border in the Great Dismal Swamp.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To choose swiddening or, for that matter, foraging or nomadic pastoralism is to choose to remain outside state space.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wet rice is, to be sure, more productive per unit of land than shifting cultivation. It is, however, typically less productive per unit of labor. Which of the two systems is the more efficient depends mainly on whether land or labor represents the scarcer factor of production.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If, on the other hand, the population chooses to grow padi rice, they represent an easy target for a state (or raiders), who know where to find them and their crops, carts, plow animals, and possessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One Bornean specialist goes so far as to argue that the very purpose of shifting cultivation was to sustain a population of traders scouring the forest for valuable trade goods.5</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Any crop that allowed people to move to hitherto inaccessible areas and to provision themselves successfully there was, by definition, a crop stigmatized by the state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cassava allows its planters to occupy virtually any ecological niche, roam more or less at will, and avoid a great deal of drudgery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ernest Gellner describes this deliberate choice among the Berbers with the slogan “Divide that ye be not ruled.”It is a brilliant aphorism, for it shows that the Roman slogan “Divide and rule”does not work past a certain point of atomization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Social structure, in other words, is, in large measure, both a state effect and a choice; and one possible choice is a social structure that is invisible and/or illegible to state-makers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The British in Burma, Leach noted, everywhere preferred autocratic “tribal”regimes in compact geographical concentrations with which they could negotiate; conversely, they had a distaste for anarchic, egalitarian peoples who had no discernible spokesman.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They emphasize the equality of access to feasting and status competition, refusing to allow those who were already prominent or too wealthy to conduct further sacrifices lest they aspire to chiefdom status.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, those who migrate to lowland states and assimilate—and historically there have been a great many—enter valley society at its lowest rungs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They might be termed equality, autonomy, and mobility, all understood relatively. As a matter of practice, of course, all three are encoded in material life in the hills—in location well away from lowland states, in dispersal, in common property, in shifting cultivation, and in the choice of crops.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The gumlao Kachin, as we have seen, have a history of enforcing egalitarian social relations by deposing or assassinating overreaching chiefs. One imagines that this history and the narratives that accompany it operate as a chilling cautionary tale for lineage chiefs with autocratic ambitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>then, by the same token, the absence of writing and texts provides a freedom of maneuver in history, genealogy, and legibility that frustrates state routines.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Such legends are, like ethnic identity itself, a strategic positioning vis-Ã -vis other groups. We have every reason to imagine that such legends, like ethnic identity, will be adjusted if the circumstances shift appreciably.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, those who were literate in the script of the lowland state would have almost certainly have been elites whose bicultural skills fitted them best to become allies and administrators of the lowland state and, if they so chose, to take the path of assimilation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lowland padi states were centers of literacy not merely because they were cult centers for world religions but also because writing is a crucial technology of administration and statecraft.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In an oral culture, there cannot be a single authoritative genealogy or history that can serve as the gold standard of orthodoxy. In the case of two or more renditions, which one is given credence depends largely on the standing of the “bard”in question and on how closely the account conforms to the interests and tastes of the audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Oral culture exists and is sustained only through each unique performance at a particular time and place for an interested audience. These performances are, of course, far more than the transcript of the words spoken; each includes the setting, the gestures, and the expression of the performer(s), the audience reaction, and the nature of the occasion itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Oral traditions, then, appear to provide, under certain circumstances, something of the word-for-word constancy of a fixed, written text, together with the potential flexibility of strategic adjustment and change. They can, as it were, have it both ways; they can claim to be precise ur-texts while in fact being substantially novel—and there is no easy way of evaluating this claim.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Elaborate genealogies are, in this respect, a vast portfolio of possible connections, most of which remain in the shadows but could, if necessary, be summoned.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By denying their history—by not carrying the shared history and genealogy that define group identity—the Lisu negate virtually any unit of cultural identity beyond the individual household.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ernest Renan was right when he wrote over a century ago: “Forgetting, and I would even say historical error, are an essential factor in the creation of a nation, and so it is that progress in historical studies is often a danger to nationality.”That is, I believe, a fine task for historians: to be a danger to national myths. —Eric Hobsbawm, Nations and Nationalism since 1780</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The confusion was genuine and four-barreled. First, any particular trait was likely to be a gradient and occasionally a seamless continuum from one village or group to another. Lacking sharp, discontinuous changes in ritual, dress, building styles, or even language, any line of demarcation was arbitrary. Second, if one did in fact meticulously chart small variations and then try, conscientiously, to justify a particular trait boundary, another nearly insurmountable problem arose. The boundaries for trait A, B, and C did not map onto one another; each yielded a different line of demarcation, a different classification of “ethnicities.”The third and fatal difficulty was that any such trait-mapped ethnicities were unlikely to coincide with the phenomenological understandings of the tribal people whose life-world was being mapped. The colonial ethnographers’ map said they were A, but they said they were B and had always been. How could that not matter? And if the classification exercise somehow survived these blows, a fourth difficulty, time, would surely be the coup de grâce. Those with some sense of historical change understood that in terms of traits or in terms of self-identification, the A had, not so long ago, been B and seemed, alarmingly, now on their way to becoming C. How could an ethnic group, a tribe, be so radically unstable over time and still be a people?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Zomia is and has been what might be called a “fracture zone”of state-making, much like the Caucasus and the Balkans.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Such powerful identities are, in this respect, no less fictitious and constructed than most national identities in the modern world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The perspective adopted and elaborated here is a radical constructionist one: that ethnic identities in the hills are politically crafted and designed to position a group vis-Ã -vis others in competition for power and resources. In a world crowded with other actors, most of whom, like modern states, are more powerful than they, their freedom of invention is severely constricted. They craft identities, but not in circumstances of their own choosing, to paraphrase Marx.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But what is novel and noteworthy for most of this long history in the hills is that ethnic and tribal identities have been put to the service not merely of autonomy but of statelessness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The formula for full incorporation was minimal: becoming a retainer of a Malay chief, professing Islam, and speaking Malay, the lingua franca of trade in the archipelago. A negeri was less an ethnicity than a political formula for membership in the polity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As suggested earlier, the Burmese and Siamese were to the numerous and varied populations they incorporated as the two thousand conquering Norman families were to the indigenous peoples of Britain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The keystone, of course, is the technique of irrigated rice cultivation that makes possible a padi core in the first place. It was not, however, a technique exclusive to the Burmese and Tai, inasmuch as it had been the basis of the Khmer, Pyu, and Mon courts earlier. The cosmology and architecture of the Indic court center is, as it were, the ideological superstructure of the divine monarchy and was adapted for that purpose. Theravada Buddhism, another import, served as a universal domain, to assemble “ethnic deities and spirits”under a new hegemon, much as the padi state’s subjects were gathered around the court. Local spirits (nat, phi) were accommodated as subsidiary deities much as Catholicism accommodated pagan deities under the rubric of the saints. Even the languages of the state-builders, Burmese and Thai, were, in their written form (from Sanskrit via Pali), linked to the legitimating cosmology of Buddhism and the Indic state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While the historical process of ingathering was a cosmopolitan enterprise, the population thus assembled came to share a set of common cultural practices and institutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the advent of modern statecraft, with its practices of territorial administration and mutually exclusive sovereignties and ethnicities, such ambiguities were common.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A person’s ethnic identity in this sense would be the repertoire of possible performances and the contexts in which they are exhibited.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first is that powerful outsiders, especially states, constrain the identity choices of most actors. Second, movement toward one of an array of identities does not exclude the possibility that, should circumstances change, that movement might be reversed. Finally, and surely most important, we must never confuse what an outsider might perceive as a momentous shift in identity with the lived experience of the actors involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Peoples whose vernacular order was egalitarian lacked the institutional handles by which they could be governed. Those institutions would have to be provided, if necessary, by force.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Batavia, the Dutch discerned, according to their preconception, a Chinese minority. This mixed group did not consider itself Chinese; its boundaries merged seamlessly with those of other Batavians, with whom they freely intermarried. Once the Dutch discerned this ethnicity, however, they institutionalized their administrative fiction. They set about territorializing the “Chinese”quarter, selected “Chinese”officials, set up local courts for customary Chinese law as they saw it, instituted Chinese schools, and in general made sure that all those falling within this classification approached the colonial regime as Batavian “Chinese.”What began as something of a figment of the Dutch imperial imagination took on real sociological substance through the traffic patterns of institutions. And voilÃ !—after sixty years or so there was indeed a self-conscious Chinese community.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The point is that once created, an institutional identity acquires its own history. The longer and deeper this history is, the more it will resemble the mythmaking and forgetting of nationalism. Over time such an identity, however fabricated its origin, will take on essentialist features and may well inspire passionate loyalty.</p>

<p>The Lisu are without history not because they are incapable of history but because they choose to avoid its inconveniences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By 1800 a kind of cultural template had been established for Lahu rebellions, which were innumerable. They were almost always led by holy men seen by the Lahu as god-kings who could cure illnesses, purify the community, and constitute a Buddhist “field of merit.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The frequency of Lahu prophetic movements allows us to identify something of a “career trajectory,”even for an activity so decidedly unroutine as becoming a god-man. A local village priest has a mystical experience—perhaps as the result of an illness—and claims healing powers through the use of trance or possession. If his claim is accepted and he gains a substantial extravillage following for his curing powers, he may claim (or his followers may claim) that he has Gui-sha’s divine nature. He is then likely to insist on ritual and doctrinal reforms (diet, prayer, taboos) to cleanse the community and prepare for a new order. A final step, one that will invariably catapult him into the archives of his lowland neighbors and perhaps sign his death warrant, is when, as god-man, he proclaims a new order and unites his followers in defiance of the lowland state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, the analogy does illustrate the way in which the cultural expectations and historical understanding of a charismatic public—often misunderstood as mere putty in his hands—can play a decisive role in influencing the script of a successful prophet. This stochastic process of successive adjustment is familiar enough; it is the stock in trade of most successful politicians and preachers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Among others, Weber pointed to the Donatist sects of Roman North Africa, the Taborites (aka Hussites) of early-fifteenth-century Bohemia, the Diggers of the English Civil Wars, and Russian peasant sectarians as examples of the prophetic tradition of agrarian radicalism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, it was not so much penury that led peasants to radical religious sects as the imminent prospect of losing their status as independent smallholders and falling into abject dependence as landless laborers or, worse, someone’s serf.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Virtually all states were monarchies, and the remedy for a bad king was a better king.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the great Taiping Rebellion, in the hundreds of cargo-cult uprisings in the Pacific Islands, in the rebellions of New World prophets against Europeans, the key figures are often culturally amphibious translators who move relatively easily between the worlds they inhabit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The shaman or traditional healer treats patients who are troubled or ill, typically through trance and/or possession. The shaman identifies what is out of whack and then conducts rituals to persuade the spirit troubling the patient to withdraw. In the case of the prophet, however, it is the entire community that is, as it were, out of whack. Often the crisis and threat are such that the normal cultural paths to dignity and respect—diligence as a cultivator, bravery, successful feasting, good hunting, marriage and children, and locally honorable behavior generally—are no longer adequate to an exceptional situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For every would-be prophet who manages to lead his followers to a zone of relative peace and stability—and subsistence—many others fail. But the coincidence of such movements with economic, political, and military crises suggests that they can be seen as desperate social experiments, a throw of the dice in a setting where the odds of a very favorable outcome are long.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Faced with slave raids, demands for tribute, invading armies, epidemics, and occasional crop failures, they appear to have developed not just the subsistence routines to keep the state at arm’s length but a shape-shifting social and religious organization admirably adapted to cope with a turbulent environment. The concentration of heterodox sects, hermit monks, pretenders, and would-be prophets in most hill societies has provided, in effect, the agency that allows many of them to substantially reinvent themselves when the situation requires it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To stand back and take all this in, to wonder at the capacity of hill peoples to strike out, almost overnight, for new territory—socially, religiously, ethnically—is to appreciate the mind-boggling cosmopolitanism of relatively marginal and powerless people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In light of this history it is perhaps not so surprising that they have been so adept at moving at the drop of a hat, reshuffling their social organization, and shape-shifting between various forms of millenarian dreams and revolt. These are, in a sense, high-stakes experiments in social identity by a people hoping to change their luck. As their situation has worsened, they have developed escape social structure into something of an art form.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, such movements have created new social groups, reshuffled and amalgamated ethnicities, assisted the founding of new villages and new states, provoked radical shifts in subsistence routines and customs, set off long-distance moves, and, not trivially, kept alive a reservoir of hope for a life of dignity, peace, and plenty in the teeth of very long odds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most hill cultures have, as it were, their bags already packed for travel across space, across identities, or across both. Their broad repertoires of languages and ethnic affiliations, their capacity for prophetic reinvention, their short and/or oral genealogies, and their talent for fragmentation all form elements in their formidable travel kit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is in their interest to keep as many of their options open as possible, and what kind of history to have is one of those options. They have just as much history as they require.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In periods of dynastic consolidation, peace, and buoyant trade, Skinner explains, the local community opens and adapts to the opportunities these conditions afford. Economic specialization, trade, and administrative and political links flourish as the community takes advantage of the opportunities in the wider world. By contrast, in periods of dynastic collapse, economic depression, and civil strife and banditry, the local community withdraws increasingly into its own shell as a self-protective measure. The withdrawal was patterned, according to Skinner: first a normative withdrawal, then an economic closure, and, finally, a defensive military closure. Specialists and traders returned home, economic specialization diminished, the local food supply was guarded, outsiders were expelled, crop-watching societies were formed, stockades built, and local militias created.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Such adjustments can take place along one or several dimensions not easily available to the core peasantry. The first of these dimensions is location; the higher and more remote their dwelling, the farther they generally are from state centers, slave raids, and taxes. A second dimension is scale and dispersal; the smaller and more dispersed their settlements the less tempting a target they represent for raiders and states. Finally, they can and do modulate their subsistence techniques, each of which embodies a position vis-Ã -vis states, hierarchy, and political incorporation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is most striking here, of course, is how closely the ideal of a civilized landscape and demography coincides with a landscape and demography most suitable for state-making and how closely a landscape unsuitable for state appropriation, as well as the people who inhabit it, is understood as uncivilized and barbaric.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dwelling in inaccessible forests and on hilltops codes as uncivilized. Foraging, forest collecting—even for commercial gain—and swiddening also code as backward. Scattered living and small settlements are, by definition, archaic. Physical mobility and transient, negotiable identities are both primitive and dangerous. Not following the great valley religions or not being the tax- and tithe-bearing subjects of monarchs and clergy places one outside the pale of civilization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ruler of Palembang in 1747 observed: “It is very easy for a subject to find a lord, but it is much more difficult for a lord to find a subject.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most inspiring things I have ever seen was a large papiermâché statue of a running figure, a “Monument to the Deserters of Both World Wars”(Denkmal an den Unbekannten Deserteurs der Beiden Weltkriegen) assembled by German anarchists shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall and taken, via flatbed truck, to the cities of the former German Democratic Republic. It was chased from city to city by the local authorities until it came to rest, briefly, in Bonn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Military portering is especially dreaded. It has been common for porters to be worked to exhaustion on maneuvers and then executed so that they cannot return home, to be forced to walk ahead of Burmese troops through suspected minefields, and, occasionally, to be forced to wear uniforms and precede the troops in order to draw insurgent fire.</p>
