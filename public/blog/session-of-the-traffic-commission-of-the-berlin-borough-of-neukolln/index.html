  content=" I heard about the session of the traffic commission of Berlin-Neukölln through the great Urbanist Magazine who wrote that cities get the bike paths they deserve and that being present at political sessions is a prerequisite to change things.
So I made my way over to Rathaus Neukölln during rush hour yesterday to listen in on the session. Even though these things are deadly boring, they are at the same time extremely revealing of the workings and attitudes of our governments and just for that fact worthwhile to occasionally visit. At the same time I think it is a civic duty to attend these sessions for the things that you are interested in. If you don&rsquo;t, others will.

<p>I heard about the session of the traffic commission of Berlin-Neukölln through the great <a href="https://twitter.com/urbanist_mag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Urbanist Magazine</a>
 who wrote that <a href="http://www.urbanist-magazin.de/2015/02/jede-stadt-hat-die-radwege/?utm_content=buffer3f5b2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cities get the bike paths they deserve</a>
 and that being present at political sessions is a prerequisite to change things.</p>
<p>So I made my way over to Rathaus Neukölln during rush hour yesterday to listen in on the session. Even though these things are deadly boring, they are at the same time extremely revealing of the workings and attitudes of our governments and just for that fact worthwhile to occasionally visit. At the same time I think it is a civic duty to attend these sessions for the things that you are interested in. If you don&rsquo;t, others will.</p>

<p>The website Berlin.de lists the proceedings of the session but it is unfortunately totally unusable on a mobile device (see the screenshot above) so I went by ear and noted what I could understand of the proceedings. The meeting protocol was I may add a bit chaotic and unclear. Part of it may be because I was ten minutes late (thank <a href="http://www.bvg.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BVG</a>
) but I would expect local political sessions to at least have signs to show who&rsquo;s who ( <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/5161572979" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like they do in Amsterdam</a>
).</p>
<p>Points two to five of the <a href="http://www.berlin.de/ba-neukoelln/bvv-online/to010.asp?SILFDNR=2578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agenda</a>
 were about improvements for cycling in Neukölln and after some debate all of these points were summarily rejected by the SPD/CDU who have a majority in this part of the city and I gather also chair the commission. For some proposals the chairs took offence and for the others they declared that what was proposed would be of no use. During the vote for each of these points they were rejected.</p>
<p>The debate about point 3 was especially illuminating.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.berlin.de/ba-neukoelln/bvv-online/vo020.asp?VOLFDNR=3834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Point 3 was a proposal</a>
 to research how to keep the bike path on Karl-Marx-Straße free of parked cars. The chair of the committee said that this problem simply cannot be solved. The representative of the police said that they don&rsquo;t have the capacity to enforce the law when it comes to this matter and that doing so would jeopardize their ability to stop violent crime ((They were <a href="https://twitter.com/urbanist_mag/status/568103116744347648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checking cyclists for lights</a>
 at the very same moment on Kottbusser Damm.)). Somebody present requested that these people be fined to which the chair replied that that wouldn&rsquo;t help either because people don&rsquo;t care about the fines.</p>
<p>The chair cited examples to the contrary from around Schloßstraße and Savignyplatz. These don&rsquo;t really seem relevant to me. Fines for parking on a bike lane are nearly trivial ((They are a couple of dozen euros where of course they should be closer to €100.)) but not so trivial that they wouldn&rsquo;t be felt in Neukölln at all.</p>
<p>A couple of people attending protested ((I got in late and I wasn&rsquo;t clear whether spectators were allowed to say anything at all during these kind of meetings.)) and said that this was a selective application of the law meant to fuck cyclists. These people were not taken seriously at all by the committee.</p>
<p>It seems that the governing parties in Berlin reject any proposal submitted by the opposition. An opposition who I may add do not seem to be the sharpest knives. Some of the proposed solutions were not realistic in the slightest. One example: replacing the DHL trucks with cargo bikes is batshit crazy. To add to that: DHL trucks parking on the bike lanes are not the biggest problem at all and something that can be solved fairly easily.</p>
<p>I went to this meeting to see why cycling in Berlin is so bad as it is and most of what I thought was confirmed. Berlin does not take cyclists seriously and the governing bodies are populated by people who say they care but who really don&rsquo;t give a shit.</p>
