<p>ecomimesis</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ecodidacticism</p>

<p>ecorhapsodic</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is providing a fantasy, an aesthetic playground in which the ideas in the book appear incarnated, a literary gravitational field generated by the sheer quantity of vivid description (elcphrasis).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This paradoxical act of identification with the fantasy object of ideology could be mirrored in critical analysis, by the relentless close reading of texts, not in order to achieve some tasteful distance toward them, but precisely in order to &ldquo;mess around&rdquo; with them, or as my students sometimes say in horror, &ldquo;dissect.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In sum, one of the principal complaints against establishing a vivid, solidly real nature &ldquo;out there&rdquo; or &ldquo;over there&rdquo; is that it just fails to be convincing. This lack of believability penetrates to the very core of ecomimesis, the most potent rhetorical device for establishing a sense of nature. The inherent instability of language, and of the human and nonhuman worlds, ensure that ecomimesis fails to deliver.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem comes when we start to think that there is something behind or beyond or above (in other words, outside!) the inside-outside distinction. Not that the distinction is real; it is entirely spurious. Thus, it is wrong to claim that there is something more real beyond inside and outside, whether that thing is a world of (sacred) nature (traditional ecological language) or machines (Deleuze and Guattari world). Yet it is equally wrong to say that there is nothing, to &ldquo;believe in nothing,&rdquo; as it were, and to say that he or she who has the best argument is the right one—pure nihilism. There is not even nothing beyond inside and outside. Getting used to that could take a lifetime, or more.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We can expect to find ambient qualities in any artwork whatsoever. We need not restrict ourselves to works that are specifically ambient, and especially not that subset of works that contain ecomimesis. In a world properly attuned to the environment, we would read poems with an eye to ecology, no matter what their content.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature cannot remain itself—it is the flickering shapes on the edges of our perception, the strangers who disturb us with their proximity, the machines whose monstrosity inspires revulsion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They are identical because, under current economic conditions, not only is there no place, but there is also no space.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Before and after the work of capital, there persists a curious silence and absence marked by traces of misery and oppression.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Although some DJs have created superstar cults, the notion of the disco or house DJ is that of an anonymous worker in a &ldquo;sound factory,&rdquo; generating libidinal pulses in a space of dancing, producing ambience, in the same way as fairgrounds provide machines for enjoyment rather than work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Marx described how capitalist alienation is fundamentally how human labor power and labor time get factored out of the process of value generation, even though they are intrinsic to it. Capitalism encrypts labor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rainforests are ransacked for biotechnology, and the insides of life-forms provide new products such as patented genomes in what ecofeminist Vandana Shiva describes as another wave of colonization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In returning to Romanticism, ecocriticism highlights the yearning for a bygone life of feudal hierarchy. Primitivist environmentalisms crave a lost golden age of interconnect-edness with the environment. They look to pre-feudal, sometimes prehistoric, pasts to discover forms of primitive communism. In contrast, futurist environmentalisms are based on the notion that the golden age has not yet happened. They acknowledge that despite the medievalist glamour, most people never had much of a relationship with their land under a feudal hierarchy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ambient poetics is about making the imperceptible perceptible, while retaining the form of its imperceptibility—to make the invisible visible, the inaudible audible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ambient art wants to make the unknown known, like science. But it also wishes to retain the flavor of the unknown, a certain mystifying opacity—otherwise ambient art would in fact be science.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Organicism, that peculiarly English form of nature ideology, paints society as a nonsystemic heap of classes, beliefs, and practices, as ramshackle and spontaneous as a pile of compost. This is a rich, compelling, and finally authoritarian fantasy—there&rsquo;s no arguing with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tolkien narrates the victory of the suburbanite, the &ldquo;little person,&rdquo; embedded in a tamed yet natural-seeming environment. Nestled into the horizon as they are in their burrows, the wider world of global politics is blissfully unavailable to them. Tolkien&rsquo;s work embodies a key nationalist fantasy, a sense of &ldquo;world&rdquo; as real, tangible yet indeterminate, evoking a metonymic chain of images—an anamorphic form.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The question of animals—sometimes I wonder whether it is the question—radically disrupts any idea of a single, independent, solid environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For Tolkien, dwarves, elves, hobbits, and talking eagles are welcome others, but swarthy &ldquo;southern&rdquo; or &ldquo;eastern&rdquo; men are not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The only way to remain close to the strangers without killing them (turning them into yourself or into an inanimate object) is to maintain a sense of irony. If irony and movement are not part of environmentalism, strangers are in danger of disappearing, exclusion, ostracism, or worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>State terror takes an interest in ecological catastrophe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The struggle between individualism and holism offers an attenuated choice between absolute liberty and absolute authority—in other words, the dilemma called America. Americans are caught between the constitution and a militarized state, between placards and pepper spray.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mud, mud, glorious mud.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since it looks like capitalism is about to use an ecological rhetoric of scarcity to justify future developments, it is vital that we recognize that there are serious problems with imagining an ecological view based on limits, even at the level of abstraction we have been exploring. And we need to notice that scarcity and limitation are not the only ecological concepts on the block. What if the problem were in fact one of a badly distributed and reified surplus?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Green consumerism made it possible to be both pro-capitalist and green, repeating the Romantic struggle between rebelling and selling out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be a consumerist, you don&rsquo;t have to consume anything, just contemplate the idea of consuming.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But this promise typifies the paradox of the Romantic avant-garde. If we could just get the aesthetic form right, we could crack reality, open it up, and change it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Both quietism and activism are two sides of the same beautiful coin. The beautiful soul fuses the aesthetic and the moral.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Likewise, there are fascist and New Age versions of environmentalism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature writing partly militates against ecology rather than for it. By setting up nature as an object &ldquo;over there&rdquo;—a pristine wilderness beyond all trace of human contact—it re-establishes the very separation it seeks to abolish.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Significantly, Althusser suggests, if only poetically, that ideology is a dimension of existence—we exist &ldquo;within&rdquo; it.167 A more engaged ecological criticism would acknowledge this environment—one we are caught in even as we judge it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The dizzyingly additive quality of the images makes us forget where we came from at the start of the paragraph, and where we are going—how do we end up at otter scat? But just as &ldquo;out of joint&rdquo; is the metaphorical slash of the &ldquo;as I write.&rdquo; Since the &ldquo;as&rdquo; slides between analogy, temporality, and strict semantic continuity, and since this sliding must take place for the passage to seduce us to visualize a fantasy world, &ldquo;As I write&rdquo; breaches the consistency of the ecomimesis even as it broaches it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only a very privileged person would make such a big deal out of having eyes and ears, of being able to walk, read, write. There are hints that nature is best accessed by the able-bodied, or at least, those with sharp, undistracted organs of perception.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ecomimesis aims to rupture the aesthetic distance, to break down the subject-object dualism, to convince us that we belong to this world. But the end result is to reinforce the aesthetic distance, the very dimension in which the subject-object dualism persists. Since de-distancing has been reified, distance returns even more strongly, in surround-sound, with panoramic intensity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing outside the dominant Western traditions, Trungpa notices how materialism and spiritualism are joined at the hip:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our choice is false if it has been reduced to one between hypocrisy and cynicism, between wholeheartedly getting into environmental rhetoric and cynically distancing ourselves from it. In both cases, we would be writing liturgies for the beautiful soul. Although it is &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; to be cynical rather than hypocritical, we do not wish to reinforce the current state of affairs. Our answer to the ruthless ransacking of nature, and of the idea of nature, must be yes, we admit to the reality of the situation. And no, we refuse to submit to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ecocritique could establish collective forms of identity that included other species and their worlds, real and possible. It would subvert fixating images of &ldquo;world&rdquo; that inhibit humans from grasping their place in an already historical nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To think in terms of either crude action or pure ideas is to remain within the prison of the beautiful soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dark ecology acknowledges that there is no way out of the paradoxes outlined in this book. Far from remaining natural, ecocriticism must admit that it is contingent and queer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If it is to be properly critical, montage must juxtapose the contents with the frame. Why? Simply to juxtapose contents without bringing form and subject position into the mix would leave things as they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If ecology without nature has taught us anything, it is that there is a need to acknowledge irreducible otherness, whether in poetics, ethics, or politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All is not lost in a consumerist universe, if only because the junk that surrounds us is so inconsistent. Its inconsistency has the quality of a clue. This clue is the secret of suffering curled up inside the very dimension of the object.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Embodied in the sonic and graphic materiality of the text, the earth quakes, setting up a subject quake, a tremor of the &ldquo;I.&rdquo; What remains after our long delve into the fake otherness of ecomimesis is the fragility of an &ldquo;I&rdquo; that we can&rsquo;t quite get rid of, but that at least can be made to vibrate, in such a way that does not strengthen its aggressive resolve (like a hammer or a boot), but that dissolves its form, however momentarily.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Heidegger has most powerfully described place as open and beyond concept. But Heidegger, infamously, solidifies this very openness, turning history into destiny and leaving the way open for an extreme right-wing politics, which can easily assimilate ecological thinking to its ideological ends, precisely because ecological thinking is highly aestheticized. The Nazis passed original laws to protect animals and (German) forests as ends in themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Romantic environmentalism is a flavor of modern consumerist ideology. It is thoroughly urban, even when it is born in the countryside.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Moving from one station to the next becomes a metaphor for moving from one word to another in a sentence. Landmarks become textual.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To see a place in its strangeness is not just to see how it is permeated with otherness. That could collapse into racism: otherness immigrates and I&rsquo;m ready with my gun. Within a horizon, you can indeed be aware of &ldquo;another&rdquo; place over yonder. Appreciating strangeness is seeing the very strangeness of similarity and familiarity. To reintroduce the uncanny into the poetics of the home (oikos, ecology, ecomimesis) is a political act.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ecological thought, the thinking of interconnectedness, has a dark side embodied not in a hippie aesthetic of life over death, or a sadistic-sentimental Bambification of sentient beings, but in a &ldquo;goth&rdquo; assertion of the contingent and necessarily queer idea that we want to stay with a dying world: dark ecology.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ecopsychology</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We start by thinking that we can &ldquo;save&rdquo; something called &ldquo;the world&rdquo; &ldquo;over there,&rdquo; but end up realizing that we ourselves are implicated. This is the solution to beautiful soul syndrome: reframing our field of activity as one for which we ourselves are formally responsible, even guilty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We should be finding ways to stick around with the sticky mess that we&rsquo;re in and that we are, making thinking dirtier, identifying with ugliness, practicing &ldquo;hauntology&rdquo; (Derrida&rsquo;s phrase) rather than ontology.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I often think that the trouble with posthumanism is that we have not yet achieved humanity, and that humanity and posthumanity have no time for what Derrida calls the animal that therefore I am.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this respect, dark ecology diverges from those Romanticisms that follow a Hegelian dialectic, the story of the reconciliation of the self to the other, who turns out to be the self in disguise.159 It gets over the dilemma of the beautiful soul, not by turning the other into the self, but perversely, by leaving things the way they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And being-here, being literally on this earth (Da-sein), would entail a need for forgiveness, an equally radical assumption that whatever is there is our responsibility, and ultimately, &ldquo;our fault.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dark ecology tells us that we can&rsquo;t escape our minds. Far from giving us a liturgy for how to get out of our guilty minds, how to stick our heads in nature and lose them, Clare helps us to stay right here, in the poisoned mud. Which is just where we need to be, right now.</p>

<p>The only firm ethical option in the current catastrophe, as I observed before, is admitting to the ecologically catastrophic in all its meaningless contingency, accepting responsibility groundlessly, whether or not &ldquo;we ourselves&rdquo; can be proved to be responsible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of trying to pull the world out of the mud, we could jump down into the mud. To emerge from the poisoned chrysalis of the beautiful soul, we admit that we have a choice. We choose and accept our own death, and the fact of mortality among species and ecosystems. This is the ultimate rationality: holding our mind open for the absolutely unknown that is to come. Evolution will not be televised. One cannot have a video of one&rsquo;s own extinction. A warning to deep ecology: if we aestheticize this acceptance, we arrive at fascism, the cult of death. Instead, ecological criticism must politicize the aesthetic. We choose this poisoned ground. We will be equal to this senseless actuality. Ecology may be without nature. But it is not without us.</p>
