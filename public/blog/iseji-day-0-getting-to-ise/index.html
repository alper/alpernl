        <p>I still need to write up how I got to Ise in the first place and why that was so terrible.</p>
<p>After landing on Narita at around 11:00 JST, I fumbled around a bit and managed to buy myself a sandwich and a <a href="https://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/skyliner/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyliner</a>
 ticket. So far so good.</p>
<p>Then getting into town, I quickly found out I couldn’t get any money from the ATMs. Not from any ATM, not with any card.</p>
<p>Now ensued a frantic game of trying things, coming up with scenarios and waiting for Germany to wake up. I have a big stack of &ldquo;issuer declined&rdquo; notices from different banks and machines.</p>
<p>What worked here is:</p>
<ul>
<li>I brought €150 with me which I exchanged for yens.</li>
<li>I got on WiFi somewhere outside Tokyo station and bought a Shinkansen ticket online with my credit card. This website is pretty broken but thankfully not that broken.</li>
</ul>
<p>What didn’t work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying for things with my credit card. It seems I changed the PIN code and forgot to put the new one into 1Password.</li>
<li>We tried exercising a physical credit card in Berlin and it&rsquo;s not clear to me how or where I would do this. I generally tap my phone at stuff and that works everywhere. In Japan this only works at the larger shops currently.</li>
<li>Japan doesn’t really want to give cash out against a credit card is what I learned later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the choice was, stay put or get myself to my accommodation. My next five days of sleeping were booked, I bought my train ticket online, so I had a large part of the money I exchanged in reserve but also I’d be going to a part of Japan that’s very rural.</p>
<p>I figured that if need be €150 would last me for a week or more if I only ate FamiChicki and other convenience store foods. So I got on the Shinkansen with my QR-code digital ticket.</p>
<p>Then at Nagoya station I tried some more machines after the German bank did some resets. Nothing worked.</p>
<p>At this point I had resigned. I bought a ticket to Iseshi and stared out the window for two hours. When there, I got word from Germany that there had been a payment system malfunction in the group of my bank and that lots of people everywhere had had issues with their cards.</p>

<p>That also meant the malfunction was over and I rushed to the nearest ATM and took out a bunch of cash. I was super elated and with the money I had dinner on the town, twice, to celebrate.</p>

<p>After six very stressful hours, I had arrived where I should be.</p>
<p>Major lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring cash on holiday. If I had brought €300 I would not have really stressed out about this.</li>
<li>Have more than one bank. I really regret closing my Dutch &ldquo;real&rdquo; bank account after this.</li>
</ul>
