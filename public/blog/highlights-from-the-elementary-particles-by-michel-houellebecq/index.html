  content="This was an interesting read and only strengthens my resolve to read most of the things Houellebecq has written.
It required no creativity, no imagination and only the most basic second-rate intellect.
It would be true to say that in the last years of Western civilization it contributed to a general mood of depression bordering on masochism.
Happiness is an intense, all-consuming feeling of joyous fulfillment akin to inebriation, rapture or ecstasy.
