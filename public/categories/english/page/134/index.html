    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This got stuck in my draft queue but I have no idea what to meaningfully add to this absurd amount of highlights. The Unwinding by George Packer is a massive and amazing work with turns of phrase worth remembering on every page. It also shows very precisely how amazingly fucked up the USA is right about now. Here is the book cut up through my lens, but I would highly encourage you to read the whole thing (I tore through it in a couple of days).

I did have this frustrating twitter conversation with them about what I think is an important topic:
@alper That’s true, but: there are already IM networks (and email, phones, SMS, Skype, etc.) out there. We’re building something for teams.

    <p>I’m currently at a German MVNO called Congstar. Partially because somebody told me that they have LTE (which is not true) and partially because I had gotten rather fed up with my Vodafone prepaid plan (branded CallYa). Like any service in Germany this one too is terrible and since then I have come to call them Cunststar.
The website is an utter pain to navigate and essential information is spread out across major sections. Other essential information that you would like to have such as how much money there actually still is on your card is not available at all. Added to that there is no actual customer support but instead you are allowed to navigate through a maze of fora, bots and other things not at all relevant.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>On Saturday evening I was in the Volksbühne for Stargaze among others to see Cantus Domus perform a set with an odd German band called 1000 Robota. After that there was an intermission and the main performance of the evening by Pantha du Prince and The Bell Laboratory.
The artistic mandate of the evening bordered a bit on the odd. 1000 Robota is more or less a lunatic act part of the melodramatic German singer-songwriter movement. Pantha du Prince &amp; The Bell Laboratory were forced to interpret Terry Riley’s in C as part of the program. Of course they said it was a great inspiration to them and they did quite a good job of it. After the official part of the program they started making some real music and the entire Volksbühne got to its feet ((I had a similar experience in the same venue where a performance by Apparat was mired by a boring play about Russian nobility.)). I asked myself: ‘What the fuck were we doing up until this point?’

In the second half though with its focus on the moral and spiritual aspects did it pick up and became a very worthwhile read.
How ignorant most of us are by contrast, surrounded by machines and processes of which we have only the loosest grasp;

A hasty temper was one of the greatest faults a general could have, and people who were provoked by insults were easy to defeat.

When the sea levels rose, they built huge dikes to protect their coastlines, and floated their greatest cities on the waves, like they did with Island Shanghai.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This pamphlet by Adam Greenfield, the first of more is a concise and enjoyable distillation of his politics when it concerns the smart city and also features a number of similarly inclined thinkers:
In this light, the casual contempt for history that is part and parcel of Koolhaas’s generic city and the comparable conceptions of urbanity we find in the canonical smart cities feels particularly glib, adolescent and unsatisfactory.
If a city can even be said to have any such quality as intelligence to begin with, that intelligence is bound to be singular, something that subsists in the unique lifeways, cultures and pragmatic local adaptations that have evolved in a particular place.

He cursed the “goddamn shitting heat”with such violence and such hatred that it sometimes ruined the atmosphere of the place
everything from wild young Turks who wanted to rip the world in half and start all over again – to tired, beer-bellied old hacks who wanted nothing more than to live out their days in peace before a bunch of lunatics ripped the world in half.

    <p>Funny to come across three pieces today wherein a bunch of fashionable faux-intellectuals are taken apart.
First Franzen in the LRB:
He writes against blogs, yet allows a comparison between Die Fackel and blogs; he writes about the way the internet disturbs the reading experience, but does it in pages bracketed into German and English sections and in notes that confuse me more than anything I read online — that confuse me more than the Talmud. He writes about competition and the work ethic, but never mentions his own Heine: David Foster Wallace, a master of the nuanced citation who managed to be both smarter and more casual, crazier and kinder.

It takes some getting into but this book is hugely rewarding and a pleasure.
it was somehow sadistic-seeming, like drilling a peephole in the wall of a handicapped bathroom.
