    <p>Last week was a week for some work in the Netherlands and some much deserved catchup with friends and colleagues over there.
On monday the protocol of the meeting we had in the Berlin parliament about open transit data was published. It contains all the proceedings and slides.
On Tuesday I went to Hilversum to give a workshop on journalistic data visualization over there. It’s always fun to give these and it’s going to be even more fun to see the results coming out of it.

The rest of the week was spent preparing the presentation for NEXT Berlin about Love in Times of Gamification. It went well ( 1, 2, 3, 4) and should be online shortly. It was an honour to be invited and to share the stage with James Bridle, David Bausola and the many others present at the event.

    <p>A long week sprinting on saba. On Monday I got a nice desk chair: On Tuesday I went to the Django meetup which was a lot of fun: On Wednesday I spent the whole day hacking Thinkup and after went to see Brecht in the Schaubühne.
On Thursday I went to a lecture by Quentin Meillassoux which was terse but interesting. Meillassoux circumvents the problem of the correlational circle to access the absolute by taking the circle itself to be the absolute. That absolute is the contingent nature of everything (contingent, to fact to artifact). What there is is only discoverable by experience. Meillassoux wants to demonstrate that the empiricist is absolutely right. ...</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Jan Chipchase’s ‘Red Mat’ design experiment is brilliant by itself, but is goes much further than being just a design experiment.
The opening of the essay that sets the contextual framework for the project is for me the most interesting part:
By now there are very few people left on the planet that aren’t in some way impacted by globalisation — as producers and consumers — those few who make a decision to opt-out must do so consciously. Yet our touch points to this interconnected system that churns out ever more, ever faster inherently limits our understanding of the whole. We can talk about globalisation, buy into it, buy from it, demonstrate against it, but for most of us its scale and complexity defies comprehension. Part of the machine is dedicated to designing, prototyping, testing and pushing to market connected products and services that know more about us, than we ever will about them.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The week started with development on saba in phonegap. I got that to work with backbone.
I created a template to send invoices from German. Unfortunately at this point the amount of text that needs to be on there (numbers in both languages, custom phrases for the tax service) makes any attempt at whitespace impossible. I’m just glad if everything fits onto one page and I can send that.
There was a flurry about the BMW Guggenheim laboratory that was supposed to call in Kreuzberg on its world tour. Some extremists threatened it with violence because they have issues with gentrification, see Peter Bihr’s write-up. The most recent news that reached us was that it was rescheduled for Prenzlauerberg, but now there is yet another piece in Freitag about the lab.
