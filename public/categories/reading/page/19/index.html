She was old enough to know firsthand that we had, indeed, shot people in the past. She could hardly be blamed for fearing we might do so in the future.
There had been a time when a property owner like her would have been shot early on, so someone’s client could take over her plantation.

Perhaps, Kublai thought, the empire is nothing but a zodiac of the mind’s phantasms.
the emperor is he who is a foreigner to each of his subjects,
that the more one was lost in unfamiliar quarters of distant cities, the more one understood the other cities he had crossed to arrive there;
By now, from that real or hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else’s present.

Rather than dig in and “consolidate his position,”or otherwise savor the fruits of victory, he proceeded to use his advantage in time to neutralize his opponents’ forces and weapons.

— Mitch Edgeworth (@mitchedgeworth) March 12, 2015
Though I didn’t read him for very long, Terry Pratchett’s books in the local library translated to Dutch were my introduction to both fantasy and a certain kind of critical way of looking at the world. Only now I’m finding out how many other people were deeply influenced by Pratchett. I’m also glad to see how a literary establishment that had studiously ignored him and all genre fiction for all that time now has no other choice but to admit that they were wrong.

    <p>I read this paper by Acemoglu and Robinson right after I read the book by Piketty thinking that there would be some interesting economic debate. Unfortunately I was proved wrong and this seems to be exemplary for the stagnation of the economic field.
It’s extremely selective nitpicking, some qualms with definitions and arguing about semantics. In those places where Piketty actually writes the same thing as them, they don’t mention it in their paper. This means that they have either not read the book or that they are being disingenuous.

This was one of the three books I read during my holiday in a cabin on the Austrian Alps. To hedge against a lack of sun hours to charge my reading device with I brought some physical books that had been lingering on my moribund to-read pile.
I wasn’t sure if ‘The Information’ would be worth reading as a graduate in computer science but it turns out that it is as fantastic a book as everybody said it was.
