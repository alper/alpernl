      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week started with Pentecost. Trying to get stuff done in Germany during the bank holiday flurry that is May is always a challenge. I spent more time working on Cuppings. In all likelihood this app will never make any serious money, but there are other advantages to building apps which may become apparent in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I gave an interview to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sz.de/&#34;&gt;Süddeutsche Zeitung&lt;/a&gt; about our project &lt;a href=&#34;http://politwoops.de/&#34;&gt;Politwoops&lt;/a&gt; which turned out pretty well:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So it turns out I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen immensely behind with the weeknotes over here, but we did start writing them at the new office now, which should make up for something. Those live at &lt;a href=&#34;http://kantberlin.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;http://kantberlin.tumblr.com/&lt;/a&gt; currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened that week was a bunch of work and getting a desk from IKEA to work on at the new place:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unbelievable how many weeks behind I am on these. That&amp;rsquo;s not wholly intended, but the last couple of weeks have been a bit busier than usual. This was the week of April 15th which I spent mostly in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a full day with the team on Tuesday working on &lt;a href=&#34;http://whatsthehubbub.nl/?s=kaigara&amp;amp;searchsubmit=Search&#34;&gt;KAIGARA&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8654049797/&#34; title=&#34;Today&#39;s office by illustir, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Today&amp;rsquo;s office&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8118/8654049797_ebe61f6e3e_z.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank very awesome coffee that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thevillagecoffee.nl/&#34;&gt;Angelo had brought back&lt;/a&gt; from his road trip along the west coast of the USA:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a big project, so pretty much everything is that right now. In between some small things happen, but we&amp;rsquo;re rather busy shipping right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did post the answer to the most frequently asked question I get, which is how you actually pronounce my name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://soundcloud.com/alper/pronunciation-of-my-name&#34;&gt;http://soundcloud.com/alper/pronunciation-of-my-name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in between stuff I dropped in on this book presentation at c-base, which was pretty weird:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8592459749/&#34; title=&#34;Hacker artist book presentation with buzzword bingo: ‘business, art, disruption, entrepreneurs, networkers’ by illustir, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Hacker artist book presentation with buzzword bingo: ‘business, art, disruption, entrepreneurs, networkers’&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8097/8592459749_b44df0f470.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two week notes in one because last week seems to have been too busy to write any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8552432673/&#34; title=&#34;Rushing through the snow towards Amsterdam by illustir, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Rushing through the snow towards Amsterdam&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8233/8552432673_d375951613_z.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 313 was spent in the Netherlands with a somewhat hectic visit. I spent a lot of time at the Hubbub studio and at the Open Coop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8557842180/&#34; title=&#34;Today&#39;s office by illustir, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Today&amp;rsquo;s office&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8557842180_b73b4d0c07_z.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course the inevitable five (!) visits to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thevillagecoffee.nl/&#34;&gt;the Village&lt;/a&gt; who were serving only &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coffeecollective.dk/&#34;&gt;Coffee Collective&lt;/a&gt; coffees when I was there:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week we were on something of a tear continuously shipping things (it beats continuous integration). As Kars mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2013/03/week-184/&#34;&gt;the Hubbub weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; I was featured in the rather shiny &lt;a href=&#34;http://thenextweb.com/magazine/&#34;&gt;TNW magazine&lt;/a&gt; about the subject of gamification. Much to my surprise this issue was filled with blabbering by Gabe Zichermann. It&amp;rsquo;s not only that we take issue with the way he approaches games, it looks like everything about the man is shameful. You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://slavin.tumblr.com/post/43893717103/futuristgerd-to-meet-these-needs-we-believe&#34;&gt;read unparalleled levels of douchebaggery over at Kevin Slavin&lt;/a&gt; and to my dismay even &lt;a href=&#34;http://gigaom.com/&#34;&gt;GigaOM&lt;/a&gt; ((I thought GigaOM was a spark of light in the cesspool of tech journalism but it turns out I was wrong.)) is complicit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The week was off to a smashing smart with the irregular Iron Blogger Berlin drinks. For some people it is an expensive drinking club, for me with my iron blogging resolve it is more an expensed drinking club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8488133407/&#34; title=&#34;Bath tub by illustir, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Bath tub&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8101/8488133407_68fddb0b28.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berlin weather has been crazy last week. Also again we did tons of stuff for Hubbub, see it over there on &lt;a href=&#34;http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2013/02/week-183/&#34;&gt;Week 183&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at Open State we are still recruiting a managing director to take over operations and lead us up onto the next level of open government and civic innovation. If you are reading this and you are inclined towards getting things done and civic responsibility, do get in touch with us:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My small project during &lt;a href=&#34;http://janl.github.com/swhack-berlin/&#34;&gt;Swhack&lt;/a&gt; was to create a django version of a delegated voting system partially inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;http://liquidfeedback.org/&#34;&gt;Liquid Feedback&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/AG_Liquid_Feedback&#34;&gt;the manyfold problems that system&lt;/a&gt; has ((Among others: the atrocious user experience, the fact that it does not support anonymity, the impossibility of i18n.)). In particular that it is written on such an esoteric stack ((The core is a 4500 line pgsql file which is a solid way to deter outside involvement in a project.)) that it is near impossible to get running without root on a Linux machine and let&amp;rsquo;s not even discuss the maintenance. What is even worse is that it makes it nearly impossible for outsiders to join the project and contribute to it significantly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Monday &lt;a href=&#34;http://uber.com/&#34;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; had drinks here in Berlin and took a complimentary Uber there to chat with their Berlin team. The experience was extremely comfortable but given big city traffic it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very fast ((I could have done the same distance quicker by public transportation and even a well-trained runner may have beat the S Class Mercedes.)). In cities where the cab market is unreliable and corrupt I can definitely imagine the appeal of Uber. People working on transit apps should take note, this is the way it should work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Swhack Berlin</title>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://alper.nl/dingen/?p=4253</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So this Saturday &lt;a href=&#34;http://writing.jan.io/&#34;&gt;Jan Lehnardt&lt;/a&gt; and I are having &lt;a href=&#34;http://janl.github.com/swhack-berlin/&#34;&gt;a small hackathon here in Berlin&lt;/a&gt; in remembrance of Aaron Swartz and to in one small way continue doing the work that needs to be done on the internet, in government and especially where those two meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have done a lot of what we used to call ‘civic hacking’ in the past, a phrase that has been used so often by now that I&amp;rsquo;m slightly sickened when using it. But there is still a lot to be done and both resistance against the movement and co-optation are growing. In Germany, where I live now, things are still in a pre-dormant state. The internet is in a rather sorry state here and people are good at complaining but less so at changing things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
