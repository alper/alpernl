I'm busy creating novel ways of organization and expression using procedurality in design and technology. To do this I write, design and build things in the most suitable medium to achieve goals and persuade people. The practice of this work yields ample examples and experiences to talk about.

[We](http://monsterswell.com) build interactive data-visualizations using real-time data and cartography on pre-existing and bespoke platforms for companies, government, artists and journalists. We conceive tools and practices for data gathering, analysis and literacy in the wide sense. We are proficient in statistics, machine learning and algorithms to create smart but humane systems.

[We](http://hbbb.nl) think of and create serious games for organizational and social change. We use the ideas of gamification in ways that are conscionable with game designers to add lasting value for players and organizations alike. We propagate new ideas in the field of games, simulations and visualizations.

[We](http://hackdeoverheid.nl) work with and without government to move towards an inclusive information society where open data and open processes fuel better services for all citizens. We believe city life is the engine of creativity that needs to be oiled by a proper mix of governance, sociality and information. We recognize the pressures that the post-digital world puts on the organizing foundations of government and we are pursuing improvements.

My talks draw extensively from our own work and from the tremendous achievements of our international friends. I can present in Dutch or English. You can [contact the Next Speaker](http://thenextspeaker.com/advice/) if you'd like me to speak at your event or conference.
