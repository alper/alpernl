Tomorrow I'm going to attend [Students for Free Culture](http://conference.freeculture.org/). I may not be a student anymore, but I still regularly ride with that crowd and the conference has a [great program](http://freeculture.berkeley.edu/fc2008.pdf) and is for anybody with an interest in the topic. So, getting up early and taking the BART down into Berkeley. I'll see if I can use my newly bought Kodak to record a couple of keynotes.

If you're in the Netherlands, there's an event along a lot of the same lines called [Volksopstand2008](http://www.volksopstand2008.nl/)( _lit.: uprising_) where a group of people will gather in the Hague to protest the attrition of privacy by our government and other institutions. I recommend you go, though I'm a bit late in doing so ((Still have to get used to this time difference.))
