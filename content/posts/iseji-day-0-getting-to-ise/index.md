I still need to write up how I got to Ise in the first place and why that was so terrible.

After landing on Narita at around 11:00 JST, I fumbled around a bit and managed to buy myself a sandwich and a [Skyliner](https://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/skyliner/index.php) ticket. So far so good.

Then getting into town, I quickly found out I couldn’t get any money from the ATMs. Not from any ATM, not with any card.

Now ensued a frantic game of trying things, coming up with scenarios and waiting for Germany to wake up. I have a big stack of "issuer declined" notices from different banks and machines.

What worked here is:

- I brought €150 with me which I exchanged for yens.
- I got on WiFi somewhere outside Tokyo station and bought a Shinkansen ticket online with my credit card. This website is pretty broken but thankfully not that broken.

What didn’t work:

- Paying for things with my credit card. It seems I changed the PIN code and forgot to put the new one into 1Password.
- We tried exercising a physical credit card in Berlin and it's not clear to me how or where I would do this. I generally tap my phone at stuff and that works everywhere. In Japan this only works at the larger shops currently.
- Japan doesn’t really want to give cash out against a credit card is what I learned later.

Now the choice was, stay put or get myself to my accommodation. My next five days of sleeping were booked, I bought my train ticket online, so I had a large part of the money I exchanged in reserve but also I’d be going to a part of Japan that’s very rural.

I figured that if need be €150 would last me for a week or more if I only ate FamiChicki and other convenience store foods. So I got on the Shinkansen with my QR-code digital ticket.

Then at Nagoya station I tried some more machines after the German bank did some resets. Nothing worked.

At this point I had resigned. I bought a ticket to Iseshi and stared out the window for two hours. When there, I got word from Germany that there had been a payment system malfunction in the group of my bank and that lots of people everywhere had had issues with their cards.

That also meant the malfunction was over and I rushed to the nearest ATM and took out a bunch of cash. I was super elated and with the money I had dinner on the town, twice, to celebrate.

After six very stressful hours, I had arrived where I should be.

Major lessons learned:

- Bring cash on holiday. If I had brought €300 I would not have really stressed out about this.
- Have more than one bank. I really regret closing my Dutch "real" bank account after this.
