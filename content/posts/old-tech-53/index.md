On my work there exists a slight tendency to use Ajax just for Ajax's sake. So drag and drop controls, the most outrageous refreshes and hyper-dynamic webpages. Little thought is spent on the eventual user experience. I do not mind really, playing with Javascript is fun if you get paid for it.

Alex Bosworth gives [a fine list](http://ajaxian.com/archives/2005/12/6_places_you_mu.html) where you should and where you should not use Ajax.
