I was writing my [literature report in Wikitext](http://alper.nl/wiki/index.php/Literature_Report) and that was working fine up until a point. My teacher had already complained that the resulting print version was not as readable as could be. I do agree with him and I would not want him to be distracted with such trivialities so I went looking for a solution.

It seemed that [wt2db](http://www.tldp.org/wt2db/) was the answer to my problems and would convert my Wikitext document into a suitable Docbook for further processing. After some minor (but unnecessary) bugs in the XML output, I managed to go through the toolchain to produce a PDF, but it looked like hell and essential Wikitext features (like definition lists) were not supported.

Looking a bit further it seems that [other people have struggled with this](http://www.hula-project.org/Wiki_Conversion) and there are a lot of half baked ways to do this. Not having the time to get frustrated with each and every one of them, I opted for the one way full transformation to LaTeΧ.

The result looks pretty good and I [stored it in the wiki](http://alper.nl/wiki/index.php/Literature_Report_TeX) anyway. It's versioning and document management features are pretty nice in any way.
