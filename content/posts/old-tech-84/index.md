Ok, that was slightly uncomfortable. I had installed the 10.4.5 OS X upgrade —quite petite at 6,5 MB— yesterday night and I had just rebooted when I was confronted with a password screen.

Now firstly I never use a password to boot into my machine. I'm the only user and I never let the iBook out of my sight, so a password is less than necessary.

But this screen would not accept my usual password whichever way I tried it, so that was a bit scary. I hardly know enough about OS X to be able to hack reset my password.

After a call to [Reinier](http://www.zwitserloot.com/), during which I rebooted, the system came back up just fine.
