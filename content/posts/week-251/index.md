Last week was my first week in Berlin in earnest and I was more than a bit eager to get back on the horse. On Monday I visited four coworking spaces, on Tuesday I met Marguerite Joly from the [Hybrid Plattform](http://www.hybrid-plattform.org/) and on Wednesday I visited a bunch more. Like [I write over at Hubbub](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2012/01/starting-up-in-berlin/), I am looking for a studio space and much much more here in Berlin.

On Thursday I booked a spot at the beta breakfast at [Betahaus](http://betahaus.de/) through [Gidsy](http://gidsy.com/) where I met old friends and some interesting new people.

On Friday I had lunch with [Rainer Kohlberger](http://kohlberger.net/) and then worked at betahaus for the rest of the day. I ended the week with drinks with the Gidsy and [Third Wave](http://thirdwaveberlin.com/) crews.
