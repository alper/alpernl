With most of my work focusing at Hubbub these days, the weeknotes over there ( [the past week](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2013/01/week-178/)) are going to form the meat of my work in the foreseeable future ((These weeknumbers also don't make any sense anymore since my sole proprietorship in the Netherlands has lapsed with my emigration.)). I may need to use these weeknotes as an excuse for long form writing again and blog more here in general on loose ideas.

I published my [piece about the Protocoletariat](/dingen/2013/01/29c3-long-live-the-protocoletariat/). I hope to be able to do more stuff in that field and tie in my professional endeavours in games, open government and computer science.

I can very much recommend following both [@Dymaxion](http://twitter.com/dymaxion) and [@justinpickard](http://twitter.com/justinpickard) for the interesting anarcho-futurist trends their interactions hint at.

I had a more than welcome catchup with [Martin Spindler](http://martinspindler.net/).

Then I started the procedures to finish the administrative year here in Germany and on to the next one.
