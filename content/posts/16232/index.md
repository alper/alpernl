> "The second thing is that there’s almost no watchable esport for a normal person. The real issue is that no one has actually made \[an esport\] that people like to play, that is fun to play, that is also remotely tolerable to watch for a normal person. They’re all baffling. I dare anyone to turn on Overwatch in front of a person and even explain what’s going on to them. The closest we’ve gotten \[to something watchable\] is Rocket League, because it’s just soccer."

> "I think there’s a possibility that augmented reality and physical controllers could produce an interesting future direction for esports. Like if you look up contemporary Olympic fencing, it’s weirdly cool-looking. It looks like a future sport. The players are wired up, electronically connected. There is a sense in which Olympic fencing is already an esport of a kind."
