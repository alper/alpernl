Looking back on 2023 I can say that we made lemonade out of an overall pretty shit year.

But not to worry. This is probably just one shit year in a sequence of many more shit years to come. No sign of anything getting better in our near future and lots of trends pointing downward. Does it have to be like this? Not in any way but the majority of people are stupid and we all suffer together.

**ACL**

I had messed up my knee in late summer of 2022 during a climbing accident and after a bit of stalling figured out that having my ACL reconstructed would be a good idea.

The surgery was scheduled for February 23rd of 2023. That made a lot of the beginning of the year waiting to go into surgery which was followed by getting the surgery (a supremely weird experience), then recuperating from it at home for a couple of weeks and going back to work while doing physical therapy.

The chronology as far as I could piece it together:

- Feb 23rd, surgery
- Feb 25th, dismissed from the Charité
- Feb 27th, [first outing](https://elk.zone/rls.social/@alper/109936914777913765)
- March 9th, [half weight bearing](https://elk.zone/rls.social/@alper/109993294605556046)
- March 12th, 90 degree flexion
- April 10th, [walking without crutches](https://elk.zone/rls.social/@alper/110173721465890389)
- April 15th, cycled on the Christiania to get coffee
- June 16th, [hospital check-up](https://elk.zone/rls.social/@alper/110553953440154789) and cleared for cycling
- June 18th, first time road cycling

I got around mostly using ride shares during the first part which was fine. Turns out that I spent €474,55 on cab rides. A fair bit of that was thankfully reimbursed by my saved up mobility budget. I stopped taking cabs and started cycling on the electric Christiania on April 15th and then had my [first outing on the road bike](https://www.strava.com/activities/9288750265) on June 18th.

During one of my final check-ups I told my physician at the hospital that if I didn’t rationally knew I had knee surgery, a lot of the time I couldn't remember it. There was no noticeable difference anymore.

Of course there are still lots of situations where I notice it. The difference in strength between the two legs is still there and catching up very slowly. But that things are more or less back to normal is exactly what was promised.

I'm cleared to boulder again from around Easter if I choose to ever practice that sport again.

**Kids**

**School**

The kids started their school year with the German event they call the _Einschülung_, something that I disagree but I have no shortage of things that I disagree with about the German school ‘system’. That's for another blog post.

The concept of the school and how classes are setup is very cool and the teachers are young and engaged. If everything worked the way it should, things would be amazing. The only issue is that most of the time there are staff shortages that fully destabilize whatever plans or schedules had been drafted. Those shortages stem from the deep dysfunction of the Berlin civil service and mostly because of a lack of funding for the schools that need it the most.

I’m not sure what we’re going to do there but for now we’re going to see if things look up in the second half of the year.

Let it be clear that Germany is a country that in no way values kids and their education.

**Father**

Related to our kids going to school, on their first school day morning my dad passed away suddenly in Amsterdam. We knew he was sick but we had no idea that things would progress this quickly.

The funeral was of course in Turkey so I took a flight to Amsterdam to be with my family and see him off and then flew to Turkey with my mother to do the burial in our village. It was the first time I was back in Turkey since [2015](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/albums/72157661588851740/with/23446696710).

That was a difficult thing to do and after that everything is different.

**Holidays**

I heard the news about my dad’s illness on our holiday in the Alps this year. Our first family holiday in a long time and otherwise a resounding success.

After all the affairs were wrapped up we went to Amsterdam for a week during the fall break to keep my mother company and to have the kids experience a bit of the Netherlands again. It was good to be back and to see people we hadn’t seen in a long time.

**Studies**

I’ve continued the trend of unapologetically self-studying things that I fancy. I can recommend it.

**Abstract Algebra**

To continue to study [category theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAi3XWCBkDo) I diagnosed a gap I had on basic [abstract algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra) and tried to close it. I didn’t finish either of the textbooks (Fraleigh and Galian) because it seems that text books are bad for self-studying people.

I worked through a couple of [YouTube lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwTQdOop-nU) on the topic which gave me much more value.

**Sheaf Theory**

Then I continued on and off in [Sheaf Theory Through Examples](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60254405-sheaf-theory-through-examples) which is a very mixed book. It’s nowhere near as good as [Fong and Spivak’s book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39681351-seven-sketches-in-compositionality?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=KeJZInPcap&rank=1) and now nearing the end it is getting very obtuse and inaccessible. I'll finish this and then move on to [Bartosz Milewski](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/).

**Japanese**

I kept studying Japanese for most of the year and on a whim I registered for the December JLPT. During registration I had a choice where I could either go for the safe but relatively irrelevant N5 level or stretch myself and go for N4.

I picked N4 and that turned out to be a lot tougher than expected. I had to push very hard on both vocabulary and grammar to get to a point where I even felt it was worth going to Düsseldorf to take the test. The 1-2 months before the test I was cramming flash cards throughout the day and studying most evenings.

The test itself in Düsseldorf was even harder than I expected and I think that it’s unlikely that I passed it, but who knows… Results are due end of January.

Even if I don’t get the certificate, stretching myself to N4 has made me study much much harder than I would ever have otherwise and I’ve advanced quite a bit. Also I got a quick trip to Düsseldorf out of it where I could eat Asian food at a level and authenticity that’s impossible to get in Berlin.

**Cultural**

With everything else that was going on, I didn’t have anything significant happen here. No time, no energy, no relevance.

I don’t really know how other people manage to binge dozens of crappy Netflix shows. I can’t really imagine spending entire evenings watching television. Do people do this still?

There are lots of good shows still that I would _like_ to watch (The Last of Us, The Bear, Succession, etc.) but there’s just no time.

**Books**

I only read 15 books this year with Galian, Genki and the sheaf theory book—none of which are listed below—sucking up most of my reading time.

{{< figure src="CleanShot-2023-12-31-at-17.35.27@2x.png" alt="" caption="" >}}

[Cold Enough for Snow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58730649-cold-enough-for-snow?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=MifrTDuHgf&rank=1) was a nice book and it also happened to be the only piece of fiction I read this year. The rest of the books above are all highly situational and none of them are particularly interesting or made a lasting impact.

**Video**

I watched six movies this year. The only notable one was [Heat](https://letterboxd.com/alper/film/heat-1995/) which I first saw as a teenager in the City cinema in Amsterdam.

When it comes to television things look slightly better:

- The Sandman: We did not finish it but enjoyed the episodes that we watched.
- Spy x Family S1: Exactly the light-hearted fun anime that I needed to watch. Nothing serious here but a fun conceit well executed.
- Tour de France Unchained: An epic dramatization of the world’s biggest cycling event that is a must watch if you’re even slightly interested in the sport.
- The Witcher S3: Nothing of note happened in this season but it was still kinda fun to watch I guess.
- Attack of Titan S4P2: It was good to watch the ending of this epic series but after such a long wait it was kinda hard to pick up the relatively complex storyline.
- Death Note: An anime classic that I started which is well executed but tough as nails and not at all compelling.
- Jujutsu Kaisen S2: The long awaited Hidden Inventory and Shibuya Incident arcs turned into a treat to watch despite the continuously escalating power levels and its sprawling cast of characters and villains.

**Games**

During my recovery from surgery I [started and finished Breath of the Wild](https://elk.zone/rls.social/@alper/109964714701040476). The irony of having had a climbing accident and making Link free-climb epic cliffs on Hyrule was not lost on me.

That was the year. Let’s see what the new one does.
