That's nothing short of an amazing list of time management techniques geared specifically towards helping engineers achieve maximum impact.

- Defend your time
- Pay yourself first
- Defend others' time
- Clearly designate interrupt-driven work
- Clearly designate low-leverage work
- Communicate with candor
- Prioritize ruthlessly

Become good at these and there are no limits to what you can achieve.
