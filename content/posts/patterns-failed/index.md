Exceedingly rare to find a talk about programming that draws on both Christopher Alexander and James C. Scott, two authors that I keep coming back to myself.

Even better that it uses them to explain why the Design Patterns failed, something that I also felt but couldn't really put my finger on—I always thought this is just a silly thing that Java people do—and how they could be better.
