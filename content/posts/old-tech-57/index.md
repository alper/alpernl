[Stumbling](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=hatred+of+c%2B%2B&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) on [a thread in Python-Dev](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-November/029872.html) yields this quite funny quote by Python luminary Tim Peters:

> Indeed, when I design my killer language, the identifiers "foo" and  "bar" will be reserved words, never used, and not even mentioned in  the reference manual. Any program using one will simply dump core  without comment. Multitudes will rejoice.
