To refocus on being available and being able to do deep work as a leader of an org I'm employing a bunch of the things listed.

- A clear calendar without superfluous meetings or vacuous rituals for me and my team
- Invest time to connect and work on the topics that are truly important
- Pull tasks for the day from Things to a piece of paper
- Prepare and minute meetings in an auto-filled daily note in my note taking system
- Block out most e-mail and slack
- Cancel meetings or counter them to 15 minutes (or just walk up to my desk)
- Set the standards and then delegate things which others should be better at than me anyway
- Proactively cancel tasks that are not seeing progress

There's no point for me to be busy. Work will find me anyway. I better be available for the important stuff.
