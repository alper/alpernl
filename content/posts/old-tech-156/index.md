[Mirroring Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/26/essentials-2006)'s move to Linux, I have six months ago moved from Linux to OS X and have never looked back until now. Last week I sold my iBook and while waiting for my Macbook, I am typing this on my [Debian](htttp://www.debian.org) GNU/Linux Etch box.

It's quite a difference.

Similarly, lots of friends are buying [Apple](http://www.apple.com) computers right now and they usually don't know where to look for good software, what to get and what not to get. Here is *my* essential list (I have posted an initial version of this before on [R-win.com](http://weblog.r-win.com/archives/algemeen/in_verband_met.html)):

**Cross Platform**

- [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/), is best used for heavier browsing and web development with [Firebug](http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/), [Linky](http://gemal.dk/mozilla/linky.html), [SessionSaver](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/436/), [Live HTTP Headers](http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/).

- [MS Office](http://office.microsoft.com/), I wouldn't spend any money on it ([DUT](http://www.tudelft.nl) provides it [for free here](http://studiolab.io.tudelft.nl/mactudelft/software#download)), but in today's world being able to read and write these files unfortunately still is essential.

One time I had to give a presentation at a research colloquy and the university provided laptop would not do anything. So I presented using Keynote and all subsequent presenters presented on my iBook using the installed PowerPoint version without a hitch. Sufice to say this was, great advertising for Apple.

**Update:** DUT unfortunately discontinued the free Office plan. This is a bit of a shame because I have been hearing some very good stories about Office 12. Anyway who needs Office, author your documents in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or HTML.

- [LaTeΧ](http://www.miktex.org), for writing anything beyond one page and containing more than five headings.

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org), oddly enough, the Windows version of Vim for me is the best version. Getting the Linux and the OS X version to work sanely always seemed too much work for the hassle.

- [Skype](http://www.skype.com), the best and easiest VoIP client I know of. Skype sucks, [Gizmo](http://www.gizmoproject.com/) might do stuff but I don't know anybody who has it. Most serious Asterisk based real VoIP software is pretty much unusable.

- [Plazer](http://www.plazes.com/info/files/), share your location easily. Plazes has lost most of its relevance in todays microblogging presence world.

- [Gaim](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/) no the new [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/pidgin/home/), is the best substitute for Adium and available on both Linux and Windows.

- [Python](http://www.python.org), for all your scripting needs.

- Eclipse is a very nice solution if you want a monolithic IDE.

- Subversion

**OS X**

- [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/), with its plugins will vastly accelerate the most common actions you take on your system.

- [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com), essential cross protocol IM client, the best I have ever used.

- [Textmate](http://macromates.com/), one of the best all purpose text editors I have ever used.

- [Saft](http://pimpmysafari.com/plugins/saft), essential add-on for using Safari, session saving is essential in any browser.

- [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/), best presenting software around. I cannot stress this enough. If you're a professional presenter, Keynote alone is worth buying a Mac for.

I might be tempted to use [S5](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/) but it's a lot of hassle and only provides added web geek value.

- [Flip4Mac](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/wmcomponents.mspx), for when you need to play Windows Media files and [DivX tools](http://www.divx.com/divx/mac/) to add a load of codecs to your native Quicktime.

- [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/), simply a great IRC client.

- [Subethaedit](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/), it's nice to be able to edit text files together. Makes you wonder where else you could apply this kind of technology.

**Update:** I have never managed to really use this piece of software. The lack of a free version may contribute to that.

- [Witch](http://www.petermaurer.de/nasi.php?section=witch), nice task switcher add on.

- [Virtue](http://virtuedesktops.info/), if you need multiple desktops Virtue is it at least until [Leopard Spaces](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/features/spaces.html) are in, and throwing around the cube is just plain fun.

- [Xyle Scope](http://www.culturedcode.com/xyle/index.html), seems to be a great HTML/CSS editor.

- [Omnigroup](http://www.omnigroup.com/), the omni group makes great software. [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/) is a nice diagramming tool.

- [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/aperture/) looks yummy judging from the movies on the site but it is very heavy weight, Adobe's [Lightroom](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/lightroom/) looks like a worthy competitor. For when I finally buy the [SLR](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos350d/).

**Update:** I have bought my 350D and I have been using the Lightroom betas for a while now. My conclusion is that Lightroom is a fantastic product for anybody who is serious about photography. I could not live without it.

**Update2:** I have yet to try out Aperture seriously but I have already read several reports of people switching from Aperture to Lightroom because Lightroom does not block on any of its operations and therefore offers much more flow.

- [Corripio](http://nclasssoftware.com/), searches for matching album art for your music. For all those peole who do not want the lockin of the iTMS.

- [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/), the essential news reader, but [Endo](http://kula.jp/software/endo/) is getting some jazz recently.

	[Vienna](http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php) is a freeware reader which does all your offline tasks rapidly.

- [SuperDuper!](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html), backing up made easy.

**Update:** Do the backup people! [Reinier](http://www.zwitserloot.com)'s Macbook recently suffered from a crashed HDD. Very painful.

- [MPlayer for OS X](http://mplayerosx.sourceforge.net/) is a neatly packaged version of mplayer and if that fails [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/) which also looks pretty polished on OS X, will play it.

- [Seashore](http://seashore.sourceforge.net/), nice GIMP wrapper for light weight image editing tasks.

**Update:** Removed this, because every time I tried to use it, it managed to frustrate me even more than the GIMP normally does.

- [DoubleTake](http://echoone.com/doubletake/) looks like a good image stitching program. I haven't really come around to shooting some real panoramas yet so this is preliminary.

- [Gawker](http://gawker.sourceforge.net/Gawker.html) is a very cool camera recording and sharing tool.

- [iTuneSleep](http://electronicholas.com/index.htm?/software/itunesleep.htm) has a clumsy interface but it is one of the best and most versatile alarm radio programs there are.

- [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) is a free and solid SCP/FTP program.

- [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/) is a nice local web development setup with Apache, MySQL and PHP neatly packaged in one bundle.

- [Parallels Desktop](http://www.parallels.com/) is the leading virtualization solution on the Mac. Useful if you want to run any other operating system on your Mac.

- [MacFUSE](http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/) with SSHFS is a nice way of attaching remote servers to your local system for easy access.

- [Transmission](http://transmission.m0k.org/) is a very solid Bittorrent client.

**Linux**

- [Debian](http://debian.org) GNU/Linux is the OS of choice for my servers. The people at Debian care and work so you don't have to. My desktop has been broken for a while now and I have been meaning to replace it with [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) but have not gotten around to it yet.

- [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) 2.0, my web server of choice.

- [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org), the default blogging application, large community, easy to setup and use.

- [MediaWiki](http://mediawiki.org), quickly start a collaboration annex content management system.

I'll be updating this list as I go. Probably lots more stuff will hit when I have my Macbook. Suggestions welcome.
