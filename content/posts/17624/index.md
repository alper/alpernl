[Krasse Links](https://mspr0.de/newsletter/) looks like yet another collection of links but the German wall of text notwithstanding, it's a remarkable act of curation and contextualisation. Remarkable and unique for sure in Germany.

There are very few people here who have the desire and skills to be able to look beyond the borders, beyond the _Tellerrand_, and who feel that what the German state and establishment press and media serve you is simply not good enough. I'd be hard pressed to suggest anything at the same level as what Michael Seemann here and any German interested in the intersection of technology and politics would be well served to read this newsletter.
