After a rather hectic week and day last Friday I went to see [Only God Forgives](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1602613/) in [Central](https://foursquare.com/v/central/4b0722d6f964a520f8f722e3) cinema ((Which honestly is a bit of a dump, but it was the best option given the circumstances.)). The movie is rather excellent if you like extreme violence or Ryan Gosling or both.

The stylized violence and disjunct story telling reminded me remotely of [This Is How You Will Disappear](http://www.g-v.fr/creations/ve-thisishowyouwilldisappear-frameset.htm). Probably not because any real visual similarity but because I am anxious for somebody in theater to produce something that good and ballsy again. And as [this Guardian critic says](http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/may/22/cannes-only-good-forgives-ryan-gosling-review), the Asian setting and lighting are reminiscent of Noé's [Enter the Void](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1191111/) which I would recommend if you can stomach it.

But the violence and the characters in essence are Shakespearian and ‘Only God Forgives’ is how you actually should do a modern day Shakespeare adaptation. The movie is a post-modern mix of Macbeth and King Lear without a hint of slavish following. I lost count of how many bloodless—in all meanings of the word— Shakespeares I have seen on the stage. With this movie Winding Refn has also just schooled all theatre directors.
