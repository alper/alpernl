Biked to the Hague yesterday and spent part of the day coworking at my friends over at [Nomadz](http://www.nomadz.nl/). Just when I had to leave for our appointment at the notary [Peter](http://www.bubblefoundry.com/) dropped by and demoed some very cool applications on the Android G1 phone he'd just gotten from [T-Mobile](http://www.t-mobile.nl/).

Here's a short video demoing the box the phone comes in (and if the box already is this cool, you can imagine what the phone is like):
