[Revision 0.4 of Firebug](http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/firebug_04_come.php) was just released and this revision also sports an impressive number of added features mostly focused on JavaScript debugging right within the Firebug console.

It just keeps on getting better and better and now the only question is what's in stall for the next release and how awesome is this going to be when it hits the 1.0 mark.

Must have.
