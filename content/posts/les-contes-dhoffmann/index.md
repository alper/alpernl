I went to [“Les Contes d'Hoffmann”](https://www.komische-oper-berlin.de/spielplan/les-contes-d-hoffmann/) yesterday in one of Berlin's three operas thanks to [this piece in the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/berlin-opera-weekend-staatsoper-komische-oper-deutsche-oper). Yes, I have to rely on a British paper for reliable cultural advice about Berlin.

The Komische Oper is a ten minute bike ride from my house and you can get a discounted ticket with some mild visual obstruction for €18. This makes it a fairly ideal way to spend a Sunday in Berlin which otherwise can be fairly quiet (stores aren't open, most places close at five or six).

I'm not an expert on opera but I enjoyed the staging and the performances a lot. The Komische Oper's productions can look a bit kitschy but this was all fairly in line. I can't share anything from the play thanks to an extremely stringent copyright policy, so below is a recording of one of the major songs by the Met.

After having severed my relation with theater, opera is something that is still fun and interesting to me. What is especially interesting about opera is that despite it fielding some of the biggest budget stage productions we have, it allows a lot of space for weird things. That is not just the case for this _opéra fantastique_ but reading the plot of any opera will leave you amazed at how cheesy it is.

The fact that opera is so open to even the dumbest of stories and at the same times is a spectacular confluence of the multimedia arts would indicate that it has a grand future. Unfortunately the average age of the attendees indicates that that is not the case yet.
