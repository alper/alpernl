Some guys are planning to hold a [Macworld](http://www.macworldexpo.com/) event in Amsterdam which sounds a like pretty neat idea.

From the [Upcoming.org blurb](http://upcoming.org/event/46690/):

> Who?

> Anyone in Amsterdam on the 10th January if you're a Mac geek, developer, user, evangelist, enthusiast, whatever! Some of us will be more geeky than others, everyone's welcome, (even if you don't own a Mac (but you might want to after this).

Pretty much most of the above description applies to me after my recent conversion to the Cult of Mac. So keep Tuesday, January 10th free and join in the fun.
