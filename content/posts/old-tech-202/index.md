After sustaining [numerous subsequent shutdowns](http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/) yesterday, I got a bit fed up with the problem. This morning at work my Macbook also went down a couple of times, which it had never done before.

So I thought I would pre-emptively cal [LJS](http://www.ljs.nL) to check on progress for my parts. It seems that my timing was extremely fortuitous because they had just received the parts and were in the process of calling everybody.

Tomorrow morning at nine I will hand in my Macbook and I will receive it back that same afternoon. Tomorrow I will also receive my [Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II](http://www.fredmiranda.com/reviews/showproduct.php?product=30&sort=7&thecat=2) lens in the mail and I have an appointment with my graduation counselor.
