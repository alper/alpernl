Tonight is the second night in a row that my Macbook suffered a random shutdown. This is a pretty common experience as testified by the site [Macbook Random Shutdown](http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/) or by the experiences of [Reiner](http://www.zwitserloot.com) and [Erwin](http://www.r-win.com/2006/09/30/dan-maar-cold-turkey/).

Now it's my turn. At least [Apple acknowledges it](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304308) in a vague statement on their site. Admitting that they fucked up is probably too much to ask.

I will pay the good folks at [LJS](http://www.ljs.nl) a visit Monday morning to have it diagnosed and a strategy planned towards fixing it. What with my:

- Squishy trackpad button
- Loose Ethernet jack
- Intermittent shutdowns
- Visible WiFi antenna
it looks as though my whole Macbook is up for replacement, though that is probably not what will happen (of course).
