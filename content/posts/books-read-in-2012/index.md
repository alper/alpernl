All of the books I read are to be found [on Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/841048-alper-ugun) but here is my year's overview because it is customary to do these things. I count 23 which is not too shabby but should be improved upon (always).

**The Sandman: Endless Nights Gaiman, Neil** Getting around to finishing all of the Sandman. Somewhat indulgent but still a very well done multi-mythology.

**The Invisibles Omnibus Morrison, Grant** A hugely important graphic novel. Also mind expanding in all the good ways that are necessary for a broad view of the world.

**Pump Six and Other Stories Bacigalupi, Paolo** More Bacigalupi. Even more please.

**Two Cheers for Anarchism: Six Easy Pieces on Autonomy, Dignity and Meaningful Work and Play Scott, James C.** A short and proper introduction to anarchism, sociology, political science and history by James Scott. One of the most important scholars for our current age of odd and corrupt governance. **Consider the Lobster and Other Essays Wallace, David Foster** Slowly getting around to reading everything by DFW. I might even finish [Infinite Jest](http://kottke.org/09/07/how-to-read-infinite-jest) this year.

**The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet Mitchell, David** Read during two intercontintental flights. Not the best of literature but still a tour de force by David Mitchell who makes everything look easy.

**Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas Thompson, Hunter S.** Another long overdue classic. Mind stretching.

**Kill Decision Suarez, Daniel** A light but important technothriller featuring drone warfare.

**Sprakeloos Lanoye, Tom** Too indulgent as is to be expected of Lanoye's novels. We're better off [if he writes theater](http://www.tga.nl/voorstellingen/de-russen).

**The Little Prince Saint-Exupéry, Antoine de** Another long overdue book. Read in French.

**Common Sense Paine, Thomas** Highly readable and very stimulating. They don't write 'em like that anymore.

**1Q84 Murakami, Haruki** Murakami is another of my indulgences however mixed his later books are becoming.

**Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive Schneier, Bruce** A highly necessary game theoretical analysis of society's processes.

**Alien Phenomenology, or What It's Like to Be a Thing Bogost, Ian** The best introduction to OOO you could find anywhere.

**Prince of Networks: Bruno LaTour and Metaphysics Harman, Graham** A very good introduction to [Latour](http://www.bruno-latour.fr/) and the current speculative realistic vein in philosophy.

**Koorddansen in de Kaukasus: Reis door Ruslands onbeheersbare achtertuin Koens, Olaf** Spectacular portrait of this inaccessible edge of Europe.

**Essays in Love: A Novel Botton, Alain de** Forgettable.

**To the Lighthouse Woolf, Virginia** Long overdue but a brilliant book.

**Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames Bogost, Ian** It turns out that reading [How to do things with videogames](http://www.bogost.com/books/how_to_do_things_with_videogam_1.shtml) is the better choice.

**The Windup Girl Bacigalupi, Paolo** Highly necessary future climate dystopia. [Bacigalupian](http://windupstories.com/2008/09/03/orion-magazine-reviews-pump-six/) is definitely going to be a thing. Large parts of the world are already living it.

**Beginning Iphone 3 Development: Exploring the Iphone SDK Mark, Dave** The book that got me into iPhone development (and did it quite well).

**The Art of Travel Botton, Alain de** Entertaining.

**Zendegi Egan, Greg** Some interesting ideas, but still not the hard Egan sci-fi one would want.
