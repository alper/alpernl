[Eelke](http://www.eelkedekker.nl) and myself were competing in the mashup contest [“Ben jij beter dan Microsoft?”](http://www.benjijbeterdanmicrosoft.nl) (trans. Are you better than Microsoft?).

Well we thought, of course we are better than Microsoft so we entered the competition. Our concept was to create [a personalized music video station](http://alper.nl/lasttv) called Last.tv with videoclips pulled from [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) based on your [Last.FM](http://last.fm) music preferences.

Despite some technical difficulties, we managed to pull this off. And our concept made it to [the final](http://upcoming.org/event/133513). On [the finale event](http://upcoming.org/event/133513) we have to present and audience voting (by means of SMS) has a big say in the final result.

So **we need as many of you to be present** as possible and support us. The event is Tuesday the 19th of December ([see Upcoming](http://upcoming.org/event/133513)) is in the Sport Café of TUDelft, [Mekelweg 8-10](http://maps.google.nl/maps?f=q&hl=nl&q=mekelweg,+delft&sll=52.372797,4.893749&sspn=3.192795,6.174316&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=51.996244,4.377151&spn=0.012578,0.038195&om=1&iwloc=addr) in Delft and it starts at 16.00.

Free beer will be provided and the amount of free liquor will explode if we win.

You can try it out at [the demo site](htp://alper.nl/lasttv) but please be gentle.
