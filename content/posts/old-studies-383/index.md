I just had a meeting with two Australian researchers who were visiting my teacher Jeroen van den Hoven.

One of the researchers [Yeslam Al-Saggaf](http://www.csu.edu.au/faculty/sciagr/sis/admin/saggaf.htm) has done a research assignment for his Ph.D. that has a great similarity to my [research questions](/wiki/index.php/Research_Questions). An important detail is that he has doen that research specifically in Saudi Arabic culture and how the internet affects personal relationships there.

He is currently busy researching political communities and new sites in the Arab world. This is a very interesting and important subject as there exists a lot of confusion and misinformation in the western world about Arabic culture. I am looking forward to reading his results.
