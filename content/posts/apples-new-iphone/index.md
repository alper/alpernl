Today was a day of many happy occasions. The Dutch national soccer team [utterly crushed](http://ek2008.nos.nl/nieuws/artikel/ID/tcm:45-384948/titel/oranje-speelt-wereldkampioen-zoek) the reigning world champion 3-0. And Steve Jobs held his annual WWDC address announcing a 3G iPhone for the masses.

“Twice as fast. Half the price.”Hell yeah. I will be getting me one. It's been some [two years](/blog/alper/552) since T-Mobile shafted me and I can't exactly say that the other telcos in the Netherlands are worth a damn. Might as well go back for 2 years of servitude.

July 11th it is and no official price yet, but I will be queueing at the store.
