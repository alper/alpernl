In the USA the shift in Congres means [good tidings for the tech industry](http://money.cnn.com/2006/11/10/magazines/business2/election_tech.biz2/index.htm). The Democrats are going to move forward on unwiring, H-1B visas, Net Neutrality and Privacy.

This shows progressive parties benefit innovation. Here in the Netherlands we have had a conservative government for the past five years and the recent elections have taken a turn towards [even more conservatism](http://brechtjesblogje.blogspot.com/2006/11/lessen-voor-groenlinks.html).

The future is looking dim indeed.
