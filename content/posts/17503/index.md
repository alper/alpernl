> Take Germany for instance — when Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer was defense minister, she tried to reform the Bundeswehr Procurement Office with little success. Currently, over 11,000 employees work for the agency — an enormous increase since the Cold War, when considerably more material was being procured by considerably fewer employees. In 2010, the procurement office was already heavily criticized for its [inefficiency and large size](https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/dihk-praesident-haelt-bundeswehr-fuer-sanierungsfall-bundeswehr_id_1891595.html), with its 8,500 employees — and the situation still seems dire.

That is a wild number of people who are not getting anything done and who then become a pension burden on the public budget.
