Anybody who's ever seen a SUV driver knows this, but the car industry themselves have verified that the people who buy those cars are assholes.

> _Who has been buying SUVs since automakers turned them into family vehicles? They tend to be people who are insecure and vain. They are frequently nervous about their marriages and uncomfortable about parenthood. They often lack confidence in their driving skills. Above all, they are apt to be self-centered and self-absorbed, with little interest in their neighbors or communities._
