I recently bought the full version of [RJDJ](http://rjdj.me/) and it is a very fun way to create a dynamic [soundgarden](http://www.tacticalsoundgarden.net/) based on your environment. I also started using [last.fm](http://last.fm) again even though they don't have an iPhone player available yet in the Netherlands ((Yet another reason to move to London or the US, the late release date in the low countries of any significant innovation.)).

To riff a bit on the the [spime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spime#Neologisms) concept, I thought it would be nice if you could scrobble location information along with the track and the moment you listened to it. I describe it in more [detail on the last.fm board](http://www.last.fm/group/Last.fm+for+iPhone+and+iPod+Touch/forum/103852/_/481136#f7918891) but nobody there thought it was interesting. At least it was a good excuse to use the term [psychogeography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography).
