It's [that time](http://novemberborn.net/2009/12/my-year-in-cities-2009-347) of the year again, a modest list this time compared to [some](http://annevankesteren.nl/):

- London, and again in September for [dConstruct](http://dConstruct.org), crashing at [Cristiano](http://cristianobetta.com/) and [Melinda](http://missgeeky.com/)'s place
- Austin, first visit to [SxSWi](http://www.sxsw.com/), definitely not the last
- Copenhagen, yearly [Reboot](http://reboot.dk), this time crashing at [Mark](http://novemberborn.net)'s awesome place
- **Amsterdam**, moving house over from Delft finally!
- Casablanca, flying in and out with [Air Arabia](http://www.airarabia.com/) on this Morrocan holiday
- Rabat
- Marrakech
- Agadir
- Essaouira

I hope to travel more in this coming year. Austin, Copenhagen and Brighton are definitely in again. A new visit to the Middle East is in order and a big trip.
