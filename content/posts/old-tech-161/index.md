So I managed to reach [the store](http://www.applecenterlijnbaan.nl/) today and got pretty much what I expected.

The guy at the store fiddled a bit with my trackpad button and he declared that it was loose. He couldn't fix it and told me it would have to be shipped to their technical support and it could take at most two weeks for me to get it back.

My objections that I bought it this Monday and that for €1200 I expect a working laptop were waved away with the statement that ‘it was working’.

Sending it away seems to be the only option and a week seems to be the nominal time. That means another week without a Mac. I still have it right now to backup my stuff and make sure I can keep working during the following week while I will be disconnected again.

Wish me luck.
