I am thinking of doing something with the Web 2.0 angle and how it connects to the ‘new’ communities that are emerging online.

Thusfar I had not really found an adequate definition of the Web 2.0 concept. It is too new and it means different things to different people. I just read [the Web 2.0 piece by Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/web20.html) and he nails a couple of important points I had thought about myself earlier.

I distilled something of [a definition](http://www.alper.nl/wiki/index.php/Web2.0#Definition) from his talk and the core of it is that the web has certain values which you do not want go against (because it is not going to work).
