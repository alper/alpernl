So that cat is out of the bag: I've taken up residency at KANT, the [Kreuzberg Academy for Nerdery and Tinkering](https://foursquare.com/v/kant--kreuzberg-academy-for-nerdery-and-tinkering/51238e70e4b04e6a13aaddc9). Peter who you may have read before on [The Waving Cat](http://www.thewavingcat.com/) just wrote [the inaugural post](http://kantberlin.tumblr.com/post/50347362153/hello-world) on our freshly pressed Tumblr (tweets are still [forthcoming](https://twitter.com/kantberlin)).

I'm in the process of moving over, getting my things in order and doing all of my other work, but I do believe that we have struck upon a mix here that has all of the right kinds of volatile creativity with a solid dash of make.

I don't know what will come out of it yet, but that is the nature of a lab like this. My main source of inspiration is the [Open Coop](http://opencoop.nl/) model as pioneered in Amsterdam North where independent entities team up and create new structures from their intellectual and physical overhead. There has been talk about all kinds of ideas already but we all know ideas are bullshit. The challenge will be to narrow things down and figure what we want to do. I do think that we are heading into the right direction. Onwards and upwards.
