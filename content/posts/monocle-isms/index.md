I picked up a [Monocle](http://monocle.com/) at Sydney airport for a long flight without laptop (along with [a book](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7141642-the-thousand-autumns-of-jacob-de-zoet)) and I was a bit disappointed ((In retrospect I should have bought a New Yorker if they had them, but this was an impulse purchase and yes I too do aspire in a modest way.)) in finding that the magazine hadn't progressed much since I first read it years ago. It still is that strangely a-political collection of fluff pieces for the spendy class and because of the current realities of print publishing now also brimful of advertorials.

I do read and enjoy (in an odd way) Tyler Brûlé's [Fast Lane column](http://www.ft.com/intl/arts/columnists/tylerbrule) in FT and it looks like Monocle itself is larded with his signature phraseology. A distillation from a single issue:

> a country's ability to \[X\] says volumes about its identity

> The forthcoming generation needs help to be globally competitive

> Infrastructure is lagging behind

> To his nearby weekend retreat

> A far cry from the polished décor and white-gloved service elsewhere in the area

> Diplomacy and negotiations don't just happen in airless meeting rooms

> Like all good campaigns it flatters the consumer

> The alcohol induced violence that often comes with bars and clubs

> Prompting eager entrepreneurs to roll in while the paint is barely dry

> The company is eyeing its prospects overseas

> The diligent start at the helm of

> The name never fails to raise a smile among \[X\]

> \[X\] is not known for its subtle advertising campaigns

> And has bureaux in London, New York and Beijing

> Has caused a stir on several occasions

> We're all familiar with the trajectory

> The problems are being discussed but significant government-sponsored solutions are yet to emerge.

> with help from an expert panel of architects

> has been developed by passionate fundraising

> \[X\] feels like a resort

> analogue ways of staying in touch are still the most popular

> it's a problem that needs to be addressed by the government, not just enterprising individuals

> The architects tried hard to infuse a sense of warmth and comfort.

> we need an attitude change

> Buyers were successful businessmen with good taste

> it must be the most laidback event in the design calendar

> it's remarkable that so little priority is given to the emotional impact of the interiors

> the clever spatial design and careful choice of high-spec domestic furniture

> The hope is that this is a model to be rolled out

> it has also sparked a longing for restaurants where home-cooked, uncomplicated food is served in familiar settings
