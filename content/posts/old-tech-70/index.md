[Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/) is the best ever Instant Messaging client I have ever used. It looks nice and works well all over the board. And you have to love the [Link Duck Dock Icon](http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=1176).

[Gizmo](http://www.gizmoproject.com/) is the VOIP client from the good guys. It is fully open source and works with SIP (built on SIPhone).

Recently [Gigaom had a post](http://gigaom.com/2005/12/23/gizmo-gives-adium-a-voice/) blogging about an [Adium plugin that allows you to use Gizmo functionality](http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=2058). This is great! There is more and more VoIM news bustling from Om Maliks weblog also mentioning Gizmo/Gtalk interop.

In any case, talking to people is going to get easier and easier.
