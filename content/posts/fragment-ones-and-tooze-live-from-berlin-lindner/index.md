Given the current developments around the German debt brake, I think it's good to refer to this bit about German financial politics and Adam Tooze's initial prediction ( [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8edcb755-b05a-4ee4-940c-f3660d4240c5), [Zeit](https://adamtooze.com/2021/10/27/it-would-be-a-mistake-to-grant-him-his-wish/)) that Christian Lindner as finance minister would not be good.

Fragment from around 45:00 clipped below:
