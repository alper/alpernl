Last Tuesday I attended the Service Design Network's conference in the [Rode Hoed](http://www.rodehoed.nl/) in Amsterdam. I've been interested in [Service Design](http://www.service-design-network.org/) for a while but I didn't really know what it was all about. This conference was the ideal way to learn more about this field.

My findings are online in [the report](http://www.frankwatching.com/archive/2008/11/29/service-design-zorgt-voor-innovatie-in-de-praktijk/) (Dutch only, sorry!) I've written of the conference for Frankwatching.
