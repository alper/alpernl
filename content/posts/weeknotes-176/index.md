This week was completely spent with work each day on project Ebi, better known as [PLAY Pilots](http://playpilots.nl). The site is due to launch this week (it in fact [launched](/dingen/2010/08/play-pilots/) [yesterday night](http://twitter.com/playpilots/status/20248282113)).

Two other noteworthy events transpired:

I got a new avatar picture taken by [Daphne Horn](http://daphnehorn.nl/). My current avatar picture was long overdue for a refresh and Daphne's offer to get my picture taken by a professional photographer proved to be both very fun and resulted in a very nice photo. The picture is now [live on my account](http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/alper?hreflang=en). [A preview](http://ikbendaf.tumblr.com/post/885917089/look-alper) was on Daphne's tumblr.

Sunday marked the end of the Dutch mission in Afghanistan, so I used some downtime on Saturday to finish project _puebla_ which is [a small map with the origins](http://monsterswell.com/projects/uruzgan/) of our 24 fallen ( [write-up](/dingen/2010/08/uruzgan-in-the-netherlands/)).

The launch of [PLAY Pilots](http://playpilots.nl) is going to be interesting, and there's a bunch of other stuff coming up: _nezahualcoyotl_, _guadalajara_ and some other proposals are progressing nicely.
