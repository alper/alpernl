> Nobody in the world can possibly tell you whether some abstract concept you just explained will solve a problem that they have. Even if they could somehow understand the wild abstractions you’re presenting them with, they couldn’t honestly tell you whether they would pay money for your solution.

> They hear “listen to your customer”and think that we want them to blindly accept every ridiculous feature request made by somebody with a credit card and an opinion.

> The point was, whatever changes we made, we had an objective way of determining whether or not the design was a success.

> The best alternative is the cross-functional team.This can be a tough change for people who are used to working in their own little silos, but combining people into one product team lets you go much faster.

> The reason this works is that everybody is working on the same thing at the same time, which means that there are no handoffs where information gets garbled or lost.
