I'm going to [The Next Web Conference](http://thenextweb.org) next week Friday. This conference, organized by the [Fleck](http://www.fleck.com) guys is a good chance to get up to date on the Web 2.0 right here in the Netherlands. Great initiative.

There are good speakers and loads of [interesting people](http://www.thenextweb.org/?r=logocloud_all) coming. I'll probably meet some guys I met during [Reboot](http://reboot.dk) on my home turf in Amsterdam, which will be fun.

And great idea: they have an actual [elevator pitch](http://www.thenextweb.org/?r=elevator) during the conference you can use to throw your idea to some VC.

See you there?
