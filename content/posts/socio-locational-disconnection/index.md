I've been tremendously enjoying [the stuff Jan Chipchase writes](http://www.janchipchase.com/) on his blog both current and digging deep into his archives ((Back to a time when comments were still allowed on his blog.)). A dream job if ever there was one.

His [current piece](http://www.janchipchase.com/shared-location-awareness) is especially pertinent as the iPhone 3G release with builtin GPS and accompanied unlimited data plans will herald the location based revolution. Many of my friends say that they do not want to broadcast where they are and know where their friends are most of the time. That they would rather get together using premediated consensual communication.

I think in user research you have to adopt the same maxim that [everybody lies](http://www.housemd-guide.com/miscellaneous/lies.php) maybe unknowingly or unwillingly. It remains to be seen how many people will not succumb to the temptation of total information. Broadcasting your location, but even more attractive knowing where your loved ones are at any given moment. The same initial reaction to mobile telephony didn't prevent everybody I know from getting a mobile phone.

What this will do to the mystery of travel and unknown locations is a whole different question [asked by Babak](http://www.babakfakhamzadeh.com/index.asp?cat=12&item=1141). I think unequality in economic, communications and political circumstances will always keep parts of the world shrouded in mystery.
