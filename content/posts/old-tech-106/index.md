On work I dock my iBook on a Dell setup with LCD display and keyboard and mouse combo. This setup works pretty well but the reverse position of the Command and Option keys on the Dell keyboard was driving me mad.

After some looking around on the Interweb I finally found a tool which helps me swap these keys: [DoubleCommand](http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/index.html)

Now to find out how I can get it to only swap my Dell keyboard and not my laptop keyboard.
