I can relate to this because I'm using Cursor to write a bit of Gleam where it's usually off entirely because this is such a small language.

It would be annoying maybe if LLMs got us into a place where literally everything becomes a React+Tailwind application but so far I don't see a huge risk that that will happen.

What is available and what is easy does of course influence what becomes popular, but nothing new there.
