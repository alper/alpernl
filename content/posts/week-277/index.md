The Willem de Kooning Academy published an ebook that contains [the lecture I gave there about digital design](http://extra.wdka.nl/crosslab/epub/) and the new aesthetic. I'm quite pleased that little piece of conceptual remix is getting so much airtime.

This week I put in quite some work on _kohi_ doing full stack development both on the iPhone client and on the backend.

On Tuesday I had lunch at [Gidsy](http://www.gidsy.com/). Any visit to the Makers Loft is fun but I go up there infrequently enough that every time I visit, the company has grown leaps and bounds. I also had a good time meeting up with [Rainer Kohlberger](http://kohlberger.net/), a good Berlin friend.

I did some final work on Beestenbende and made arrangements to visit Helsinki next week to present on an event organized by Virtueel Platform for its [World Design Capital](http://wdchelsinki2012.fi/en/pavilion) program.

At last we also are doing internal work at Open State / Hack de Overheid both on the design front ((Procuring a new identity of course.)) and on strategy to prepare us for a next phase that will entail considerable growth as well as maturation for the foundation.

And not something that we did, but still nice to hear that KiesBeter.nl [has started publishing data](https://twitter.com/ton_zylstra/status/220898350000644096). Ton Zijlstra and I gave a workshop there last year to show them the potential of open data and after the required time to process these things internally, it has happened.

And that Friday it was off to Wartin with a whole bunch of awesome Berlin people on a weekend organized by [the kind people of Third Wave](http://thirdwaveberlin.com/2012/07/week-92/). We had our fill of good conversations, nature and late night werewolf.
