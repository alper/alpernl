I've changed my monthly contribution from the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/international) to the [Taz](https://taz.de/).

The Guardian is a bit weird and was not doing that much for me anymore. It's not clear what they're about and I'm mostly disappointed in their roster of writers.

Taz, I only read occasionally but they're local (with an office that is practically next to my house) and they're a lot more left-wing than the Guardian is.

I haven't found many good alternative newspapers other than the FT which is ridiculously expensive.
