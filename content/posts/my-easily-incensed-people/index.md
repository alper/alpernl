A Turkish guy in a van turns the corner tight enough to almost run us over. He then stops and pulls down the window: "Möchtest du mir etwas sagen?"

To which I better don't reply: "Ja, 'senin ananı babanı sikeyim.'"

These guys are so easily triggered. Once I did say this and the dude followed me through half of Schöneberg in his car.
