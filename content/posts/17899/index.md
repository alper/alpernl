It's rare to find writing in German as lithe and delightful as what Christoph Rauscher puts out. The monthly lists are [one particularly good example](https://christowski.de/blog/2024/12/dezember-liste-2024/). I'm learning new and interesting words still in most of his pieces.

I totally agree that "Writing = Design" and you should hire him for Design/Writing/Illustration: [https://christophrauscher.de/writing/](https://christophrauscher.de/writing/)
