Due to a slight mishap at the mail server of my university I have not been able to receive any e-mail in the past 48 hours. All of it seems to have disappeared into a gaping black hole.

Things had never been this quiet before in my Gmail. It got me spooked.

Resend if it was important, or try [something else](http://www.alper.nl/contact.html).

**Update:** No mail has been lost, it was merely displaced. I have recovered everything and set up proper filtering again.
