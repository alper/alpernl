Friends of motion studio [Eelke Dekker](http://www.eelkedekker.nl/) and design agency [Booreiland](http://www.booreiland.nl) have gone into seclusion for a week in the East of the Netherlands to concept, shoot and produce a movie within that week, **[project .mov](http://dotmov.tumblr.com/)**. No ulterior motives, just making a movie for the love of making a movie (and having made that movie).

Some years ago without a budget and far less experience they'd already produced [the classic Frag](http://www.vimeo.com/597113). It took some time however to find the right moment and opportunity to make another one. Now that moment is there with more time, better gear, actually **better everything** and a recipe for awesome.

Now, any movie needs an audience, but the fun part of this project is that you can track the _making of_ as it goes along. It is all being documented in [glorious HD](http://vimeo.com/user2964712), [tweets](http://twitter.com/dotmov) and [photographs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/eelkedekker/). You can checkout the progress of the movie on the [tumbleblog for dotmov](http://dotmov.tumblr.com/) or follow the [dotmov account on Twitter](http://twitter.com/dotmov). As this video testifies, even if you can't be there, it is really fun and insightful to follow the creative process from afar:

More to follow and I can't wait to see the end result (or more in progress movies for that matter).
