A [lot of raves](http://www.kottke.org/08/07/rave-for-apples-keyboard) for the new line of Apple Keyboards also from me. [Cris](http://cristianobetta.com/) has been so kind to import one for me from London ((Something to do with Apple Store discounts.)).

This keyboard has improved my workplace conditions massively. It's a pleasure to sit down at my desk and start typing on it. I'm currently pairing it with my old Logitech MX500 mouse but that is bound to go wireless as well. I may be tempted to haul the whole installation on the road but I don't want to end up looking [like this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/niallkennedy/2631411119/).

Now I just need to find something to prop up my Macbook much much higher. I'm currently putting it on a pile of UX books, which could be a sign I need to increase my reading speed.

About the sizing issue. The Bluetooth keyboard's size is perfect. The layout is nearly identical to my Macbook keyboard's layout, which means I have no switching costs going back and forth. A numerical keypad I would hardly use anyway, and the six buttons above the arrows are easily replaced with the Mac key chords.
