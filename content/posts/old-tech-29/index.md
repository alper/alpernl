I already knew [Jesse James Garrett](http://blog.jjg.net/) from [Adaptive Path](http://www.adaptivepath.com/) was coming to Amsterdam to give [a workshop](http://www.adaptivepath.com/events/2005/nov/). For a student like me these kind of things have too high price cards attached, but in the recent newsletter there is also the announcement of an open cocktail drink afterwards.

> In Amsterdam, on November 7, we will be at Rose's Cantina, Reguliersdwarsstraat 38-40, 1017 BM, Amsterdam, from 5:30 p.m.-7:30 p.m.
