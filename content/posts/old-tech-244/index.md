I must say I'm pretty thrilled that [our little mashup](http://lasttv.net) was [mentioned on stage](http://lasttv.net/news/2007/02/27/lasttv-mention-at-fowa/) at the Future of Web apps.

**Update:** The slide is gone, but you can see [the Last.fm deck](http://www.futureofwebapps.com/presentations/matt_ogle.pdf) on [the FOWA website](http://www.futureofwebapps.com/). Our slide is some way in.
