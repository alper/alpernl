The best thing about this return-to-office model is that it is differential and contextual. Whether the exact categories make sense and who falls in which is something that you can debate ad infinitum.

What should be added there though is that without deliberate change and practice—things that people and companies are not great at—most people and companies will by default be pretty bad at remote and hybrid working. People will find a local optimum and be content staying there.
