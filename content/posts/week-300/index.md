Last week was a week without travel or deadlines so a lot of stuff that had been lying around for too long got done.

I did some more work on the small secret project ((I regret not picking a codename for it now. Henceforth it shall be known as REYNOSA.)). Also going forward with work on TORREON.

Chris Eidhof dropped by briefly at Praxis and told me about his [plans to organize an iOS conference](http://iosinberlin.launchrock.com/) in Berlin.

I bit the bullet and got myself [a monthly ticket for the U-Bahn](http://www.bvg.de/index.php/de/131809/name/Wochen-/article/11722.html) along with a ticket for my bike. This has made a huge different in getting around the city. Many trips which would take half an hour by bike are a lot easier now and especially with the snow the combination of transit+bike makes a lot more stuff possible.

I enrolled in a conversational German course at the [Goethe Institute](http://www.goethe.de/enindex.htm) to up my German to a professional level. We are going to get a new collaborator over at Praxis. And I went to my first ever CrossFit training session on the recommendation by [Mustafa Isik](https://twitter.com/codesurgeon).

I finally bit the bullet and changed my T-Mobile Netherlands plan to something a bit more minimal because I don't spend much more than a week a month in the Netherlands anyway. On Thursday I sent a new proposal for TORREON. I did more stuff on REYNOSA.

I got the funny (for Berlin's reputation, see [this Times piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/magazine/in-berlin-you-never-have-to-stop.html?pagewanted=all)) sticker for the new play Sommergäste by the Schaubühne written by Maxim Gorki. The previous play by that same director, [Eugen Onegin](/dingen/2012/03/toneelgroep-amsterdam-husbands/#footnote_0_3389), was absurdly boring so hopes for this adaptation of a Russian master should not be too high. Another Schaubühne play we almost went to, [The Black Rider](http://schaubuehne.de/en_EN/program/detail/11049921) ((Really, the massive misguided stones necessary to translate Burroughs into German…)), seems to be by all accounts also really rather terrible.

Theater is a hopeless moribund discipline but [Fabian Hinrichs may prove a notable exception](http://www.hebbel-am-ufer.de/programm/spielplan/hinrichs-die-zeit-schlaegt-dich-tot/108/) in Berlin this week (which I'll be missing because of travel to Amsterdam).

This week was also the week of [the brilliant eulogy for occupy by Quinn Norton](http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/12/a-eulogy-for-occupy/all/). Intentional or not, it confirmed my cynicism about the movement. What little sparks of brilliance and hope were to be found in the USA versions were almost totally absent from the Dutch camps. Around the studio here in Kreuzberg there are still some remnants of the movement active:

Friday I started initial work on TORREON and after that I went to the [VVVV](http://vvvv.org/) 10th anniversary event over at [Letters are my friends](https://foursquare.com/v/letters-are-my-friend/4de94addd22d09215a32e22b).

Twitter announced the general availability of your own tweets for download in archive form. I had [done some preliminary work](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2012/04/a-full-twitter-index-in-your-thinkup/) on this when this option was available to Europeans and now [ThinkUp is busy building](https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/issues/1413) a full-fledged importer.

Sunday morning I finished reading [The Invisibles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisibles), a brilliant mind bending comic by Grant Morrison. It may not seem like it is relevant to my work, but it very much is in a multitude of strange ways.
