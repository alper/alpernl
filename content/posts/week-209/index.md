Last week Monday we saw the final work presentations at the [Willem de Kooning Academy](http://www.wdka.nl/). It was a great experience and I was really blown away by the breadth of some of the work presented. Nevertheless it remains a challenge to fit a full data visualization curriculum within the course of 4 weeks. Given the time we had I am very proud of the progress made.

I met an old friend from Delft to talk about aiding him in his architectural PhD doing information architecture and visualization of the concepts in his research. This looks like a great opportunity to bring into practice my thinking and engagement in the field of architecture.

Finally, I rushed over to the [TMG](http://www.tmg.nl/) building to give an interview for Dutch Radio 1 during WNL's Avondspits show. I ripped and uploaded the interview (in Dutch) to Soundcloud. You can listen to it below:

Those that know me may be surprised by my parliamentary tone (which is a discipline that comes in handy from time to time).

I also put the last touches to [the article on Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/2011/03/hackdeoverheid-wederom-een-succes/) recapping our event and its success.

_Maguro_ is running strong during its pilot, though small inbalances forced us to do some run-time tweaks. All in a day's work.

Wednesday, I made my way out to Ermelo to give a workshop for the journalists of the regional broadcasting corporations, [the ROOS-dagen](http://roosdagen.nl/). My subject matter —data journalism and visualization— is rather edgy for this crowd which was visible in the turnout. Those few who are willing to run with it, may find though that at the local and hyperlocal levels, a little data goes a long way.

Made it back just in time to congratulate [Alexander Klöpping](http://twitter.com/alexandernl) on the book he wrote [“Wikileaks: Alles wat je niet mocht weten”](http://www.mediamatic.net/page/199278/en).

Thursday we celebrated our friends' achievement in organizing the tenth [This Happened Utrecht](http://www.thishappened.nl). Organizing ten editions of any event is a feat in and of itself, organizing ten This Happened Utrecht events to the consistent high quality standard of curation, facilitation and audience that Kars, Alexander and Ianus have, is nothing less than formidable.

Through Kars's curation there are also a number of very nice interactive installations on display to play with on the Neude square for the [Tweetakt](http://www.tweetakt.net/) theatre festival. I encourage you to drop by (free!) and try them out.

Worked a bit more on _acapulco_, some projects should receive more attention (and this one certainly will). Frideay we also received our soon to be new office mate [Joris Machielse](http://twitter.com/machielse).

[Statlas](http://statlas.nl) is running up to its first public release. Very soon now.
