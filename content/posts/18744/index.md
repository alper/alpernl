A good list about how anybody can be exceptional at something:

* Show extreme care
* Know your first solution is probably terrible; rethink it
* Pay extreme attention to small details
* Always follow up
* Own up to your fuck-ups

Details on every point are on the post linked below, but this is everything and doing this well is already an infinite amount of work. Which means you have to choose wisely.
