I'm spending a lot of time hacking [Drupal](http://drupal.org) and the [PHP](http://www.php.net) it is built out of. My impression of PHP is worsening by the day. Drupal itself is a mixed bag. It does a lot of stuff for you, which is good but the documentation is lacking if you want to do anything non-standard or slightly complex.

I'm looking forward to spending some time again with [a system which has semantics, namespaces and a sane templating system](http://www.djangoproject.com/).
