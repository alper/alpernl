I agree with this with two additions:

Most of the time things are not at all complex, they are complicated. Those are two very different things.

Complications can be a symptom of avoidance but maybe oftentimes the work _is_ complicated. If all the work was simple, any idiot could do it. Appreciate the real complexity of the work while you are in the act of cutting through it.
