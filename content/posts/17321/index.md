Last week I was making a presentation and I came across Deming and his principles. I have often gotten the question: "If you don't measure X, then how will you know we're doing well or improving?" which I always felt was misguided.

It turns out that Deming was way ahead of me there, he says: "Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers, numerical goals. Substitute leadership."

Leadership is always the key.
