A somewhat more downpaced week with a bit of a cold in the middle, but:

One big ticket was finishing and launching the [Bandjesland](http://playpilots.nl/games/bandjesland/) addition to [PLAY Pilots](http://playpilots.nl).

Hung this poster on the studio:

Unfortunately lost the other half on the subway (don't ask…).

Some more nice additions to the office:

I got an iPad thanks to [Peerz](http://www.peerz.nl) a new professional rating and recommendation startup.

Had a bunch of meetings with people: [Utrechts UIT Bureau](http://www.utrechtsuitburo.nl/), [Vrij Nederland](http://www.vn.nl) and [de Groene Amsterdammer](http://groene.nl).

Friday Bandjesland was launched and I worked a bit on the new [Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl) site and went into a wonderful work-free weekend.
