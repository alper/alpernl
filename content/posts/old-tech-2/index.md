Atom 1.0 has been out for a while and the deprecation of the previous 0.3 version should have everyone updating their feeds to be 1.0 compliant.

I had implemented 1.0 quite quickly after the release but some sloppiness prevented that feed from validating on the [feed validator](http://feedvalidator.org/).

Looking at [an example](http://annevankesteren.nl/feeds/weblog) of a validating feed and [an incitation](http://annevankesteren.nl/2005/09/atom) that I should also produce similar made me better my feed.

Atom 1.0 feeds for: [personal](http://192.168.0.1:9673/blog/alper/atom10_xml), [tech](http://82.156.122.105:9673/blog/tech/atom10_xml) & [study](http://82.156.122.105:9673/blog/study/atom10_xml).
