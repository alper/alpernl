I have an [updated course list](http://www.alper.nl/studie0506.html) online for this final year of mine doing courses at our fine university.

I have a pretty clear strategy how I am going to get each of those courses that are still missing. It should not be such a big deal.

The only problem currently is that I do not have the course list I handed in to the exam committee. They should have given me back a copy, and I should have given a copy to Mr. van der Mast.

I'll hunt that down this week.
