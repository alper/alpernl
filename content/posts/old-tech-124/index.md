Very cool ideas for some nice technology (Wired: [MIT Fashion Design Takes Cue From Virus](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1960058,00.asp)) and the thing they did for a prototype is a great illustration. Now if only they could get the per unit price down (Zauruses don't come cheap).

Imagine if your clothes changed color on your mood, or on who's in your proximity or based on anything really. You could indicate your concentrated or *Away*. Very fun but probably only for the ultra-geek until some designer makes it fashionable and usable at the same time.
