Lots of writing last week. We submitted the maguro project as a practice report to the [DiGRA conference](http://gamesconference.hku.nl/). Also wrote a bit of damage control on the Apps for Amsterdam contest regarding the implications of a certain submission: [“Dude! Where's my car?”](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/2011/05/inzending-dude-wheres-my-car/) Decisions made border on the ludicrous and it falls upon us as [Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl) to choose the side of sanity. Finally I punched out some meta-writing about the conundrums of writing (or trying to write) for larger audiences: [“Why write about games?”](/dingen/2011/05/why-write-about-games/)

Real estate wise it looks like [our space](http://twitter.com/ouroffice) in the [Volkskrantgebouw](http://volkskrantgebouw.nl/) may double and we will be able to expand our own activities and invite in friends. That will be awesome and add greatly to the dynamic of the studio. Stay tuned!

Tuesday saw the long expected completion of the [Dufarge](http://www.dufarge.com/) web store, a favor to our kind friends —nay! design superheroes— over at [Buro Pony](http://www.buropony.nl). Quite pleased that we managed to pull that one off in the in between hours.

Wednesday we had a [Foursquare meetup](http://www.meetup.com/foursquare/Amsterdam-NL/112771/) here in Amsterdam with [Naveen](http://twitter.com/naveen) of Foursquare fame and a bunch of local enthousiasts. Lots of ideas still to do cool stuff with Foursquare but not much time.

Thursday we gave an interview about the upcoming [Statlas](http://www.statlas.nl) launch due soon to be online over at our friends of the [Stimuleringsfonds](http://www.stimuleringsfondspers.nl/). After that it was an open night at many venues for Creative Amsterdam and I went on a tour d'Amsterdam with Edial and we hit: [Grrr](http://grrr.nl/), [Foam](http://www.foam.nl) and [steim](http://www.steim.org/) among other venues.

Also some robots, just for good measure:
