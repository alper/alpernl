I've been playing Breath of the Wild while I'm lying flat and my experience is identical to that of Craig here. All the way back to the gold cartridge I used to have for the NES as a kid.

Not being able to walk for a couple of weeks has been hugely ameliorated by being able to walk, scramble, climb across the continent of Hyrule. The walks and the 'boredom' of the game are worth leaning into.
