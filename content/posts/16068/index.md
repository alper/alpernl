> so people never settle … they simply won’t stop tweaking their tools, instead of focusing on the actual work.

Another piece of a company that has a broken culture (he is literally writing it) and is blaming that on the tool that they use.

To be fair, I think that these kind of open tools probably don't scale past 10 people. It sure would be nice but you just can't expect everybody to be a superstar power user of the tool your company is using. People have lives and they probably don't care about this as much as you do. Tools need to accommodate that.
