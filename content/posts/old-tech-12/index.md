I just read the need for a hAtom microformat [at Torres](http://torrez.us/archives/2005/10/07/404). Microformats have appealed to me for a while now but I am a new tochnology junkie.

The question is what kind of advantages will a richly annotated semantic web have to offer for most of us? Mark [Pilgrim offers a vision](http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2005-October/001112.html) and a very practical path to reach it.
