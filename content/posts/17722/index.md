> Hard work isn’t always the work that takes the most time, or the work that gets paid the most. The hardest work is the work that challenges, makes us uncomfortable, or requires change. If we actually value hard work — we have to do some of our own.

I sure missed AHP's writing. This is one about why people think that the next generation does not ‘work hard’ anymore.
