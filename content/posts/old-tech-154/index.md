I am currently calling customers to get their feedback, and more often than not I receive out of office, out to lunch or in meeting statuses.

So either I have to call them again later or they have to call [TOPdesk](http://www.topdesk.com) back and get put through to me.

Wouldn't it be so much nicer if all the people I wanted to call were in my [Skype](http://www.skype.com) list. I could see their presence and message them to ask if it was all right to call them right there and right then.

And I wouldn't need a telephone anymore but I could just plug a USB headset into my monitor and be off.
