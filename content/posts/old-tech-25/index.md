Over at the BBC they are doing really really interesting stuff (of which I hope our broadcasting corporations would take serious note).

One of them is the BBC program catalogue which they are [turning into a public website](http://www.benhammersley.com/weblog/2005/10/31/hot_bbc_archive_action.html). Just couple this resource to direct streaming downloadability and you have an incredibly valuable archive of cultural heritage.

The whole thing is built in Rails and they are going to talk about it during the [London Web Frameworks Night](http://blog.unixdaemon.net/cgi-bin/blosxom.pl/events/frameworks_night_short.html) which I would love to attend.

Another cool one is the [Annotatable Audio Project](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2005/10/on_the_bbc_annotatable_audio_project.shtml). Anotating stuff is cool, and this would really help us deal with the huge reams of podcasting that is springing into existance. Metadata, annotating and tagging really is key to making sense of that (or any) jungle.
