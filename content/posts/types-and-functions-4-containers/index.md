> _Functor_ is simply an interface with a contract. We could have just as easily named it _Mappable_, but now, where's the _fun_ in that?

It would have been nice if the name was easy and logical but at least now I finally know what a `Functor` is. None of the other guides or tutorials really managed to explain that.

> At the time of calling, a function can be surrounded by `map`, which transforms it from a non-functory function to a functory one, in informal terms. We call this process _lifting_. Functions tend to be better off working with normal data types rather than container types, then _lifted_ into the right container as deemed necessary.

A decent explanation of lifting is also nice to have though without too many examples I don't think this will stick.

The rest of the chapter including the introduction of `IO` is just one big: “Why would you do this?”
