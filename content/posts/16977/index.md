Love to see these updates from the German Digital Service. Not sure everybody knows that that organization exists now and what they're busy with.

The work they're doing is really good but what's really staggering is how much of a gap they have to bridge here. These are basic buildings blocks of digital transformation that advanced societies tackled 10-20 years ago.
