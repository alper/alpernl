Please let's never talk about GitFlow ever again other than with stories like this of how we moved people away from it.

Some teams will be willing to try something else and see how it makes their lives radically better and others will refuse and put their heels in the sand.

Sure there are reasons why people react in a certain way, why some people are protective or conservative but those reasons are not destiny and everybody can choose agency and make things better.

What choice will you make?
