### Monday

Work on [PLAY Pilots](http://playpilots.nl) and preparations for Urbanode (actually all week long). Some development on _aguascalientes_.

### Tuesday

Meeting with [Amsterdams UITbureau](http://www.amsterdamsuitburo.nl/). They are doing some very cool things to promote the city.

Got the business card comps by [Bureau Pony](http://www.buropony.nl) which are going to be utterly smashing.

Did a big [Urbanode](http://twitter.com/urbanode) test with [James](http://www.lifesized.net/) and [Peter](http://www.bubblefoundry.com/). Got everything back up and running and talking with each other. Also got the mobile version to work with something of a workaround.

Then worked deep into the night for a release of _querétaro_.

### Wednesday

Did a demo of Urbanode for [Kennisland](http://www.kennisland.nl/) at [Melkweg](http://www.melkweg.nl/) with everything working at base level. An incredible refutation of Murhpy's Law.

Then went out to a strategic dinner with [Hubbub](http://www.whatsthehubbub.nl) after congratulating [Sjoerd Wennekes](http://twitter.com/SjoerdWennekes) with his MBA (!).

I could use some interns for [Monster Swell](http://monsterswell.com). There's more than enough work to be done in programming, cartography, journalism, writing, design and assorted. If you think you qualify for an internship send me a sample of your solid work and have your people contact my people.

### Thursday

Coffee with [Johnny Wonder](http://johnnywonder.nl/). A bunch more work on [PLAY Pilots: Bandjesland](http://playpilots.nl/games/bandjesland/) and preparations for presenting at Open Innovation Festival.

### Friday

Gave my presentation for [Open Innovation Festival](http://www.openinnovationfestival.com/) at the plenary meeting room in City Hall. That was fun.

Had lunch with front-end superstar [Kilian Valkhof](http://kilianvalkhof.com/) with some more than decent coffee.

End of the afternoon I gave a brown bag presentation at [Adaptive Path Amsterdam](http://www.adaptivepath.com/). It was a more informal and updated version of my [Civic Duty in a Hyper-Connected World](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2010/10/slides-for-civic-duty-in-a-hyper-connected-world/).

### Saturday

Saturday we had [Open Data Day](http://www.opendataday.org/) at [@ouroffice](http://twitter.com/ouroffice). Turnout was not that large due to a snow storm and Sinterklaas, but we did an in-depth analysis of a soon to be opened dataset.

The rest of the weekend I played around with installing [OpenCV](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/) but could not manage to get [the python bindings](http://code.google.com/p/pyopencv/) to install on my OS X so I gave up on that ((I've spent more than enough time in my life chasing down C++ library and linkage errors.)), the Java Processing library also flaked out.
