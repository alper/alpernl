I recently discovered [Guy Kawasaki's blog](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/ ) and its content is as great as its title: *“Let the Good Times Roll”*.

His commentary on all aspects tech-entrepeneurial makes a lot of sense and is fun to read. His [piece on evangelism](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/the_art_of_evan.html) hit home with me because I try to do quite a bit of that.

I am the person most ahead on the tech curve at [our local shop](http://www.topdesk.com) and trying to get people to go along with recent developments involves quite a lot of pulling.

Trying to inject innovation into an adverse environment such as this gets a bit tiring after a while.
