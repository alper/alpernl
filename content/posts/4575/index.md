The turn above from Rosa-Luxemburg-Straße into Schönhauser Allee yesterday around 19:15 is where I almost got hit by a woman driving a black car with license plates **LDS HS 179**. Shaken but not too shaken I pursued them up the street to demonstrate my discontent and to write down the plate number.

I should have seen that they weren't going to stop though they usually do but this was rather unexpected during a leisurely evening ride where absolutely nothing should have gone wrong.

[Police](http://www.berlin.de/polizei/bezirk/dir3/a31.html) will be contacted on Monday and then we'll see how far this can be pursued.
