I am currently reading the book [“The Internet and Society”](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745620876/002-8265165-7409648?v=glance&n=283155) by James Slevin which went off to a rough start but which I am getting into more and more.

In chapter three it discusses *‘the study of the internet as a modality of cultural transmission’*. Interesting stuff, I will post more about this later.
