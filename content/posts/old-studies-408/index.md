[Podshaala](http://podshaala.blogspot.com/) from Barcamp Bangalore: When will every course be podcast right after the fact?

I'm talking enhanced Quicktime with Audio/Video and chapter marks and slides in the form of album art. I could view any course on any topic I want right from within iTunes.

This raises the question: How does a professor catch students' attention in a long tail environment?
