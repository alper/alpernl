I usually say that application development (mobile and otherwise) is a solved problem but once you go to any kind of scale, you run into all of these operational issues which keep things interesting.

By a solved problem, I mean that figuring out what to build and building it is by now, for an experienced team, a linear endeavor. Aligning the rest of the organization to be able to do this, however, not so much.
