The week before last (I'm running one week behind), was a good weak. Easter Monday was spent cleaning up the house which is now finally fully operational and fit to live in.

Tuesday was spent getting back on top of work.

In the evening I got tipped of by [Mathias Schindler](http://twitter.com/presroi) that there would be a talk in [St. Oberholz](http://www.sanktoberholz.de/) about the value of free knowledge. I visited it but it was more of a free for all with the writer spouting their well trodden arguments (and quite a bit of gibberish) and Mathias doing much of the same.

I have written before about how copyright in Germany is locked up in a fierce protectionist policy that benefits only those that have something to lose and not those with something to gain. Germany's cultural production is not even that interesting for the world at large, but the biggest reason to maintain it: it employs a lot of people. The debate right now is strangely being dominated by ‘Tatort-autoren’ which is odd since the show is on public television and quite dull.

The transition to more dynamic (i.e. not as strictly regulated) copyright is underway and the more the powers try to protect copyright, the more they expedite its demise. It still must be painful for the Tatort man and all those in his camp to be so very much on the wrong side of history.

Also, I'm going to talk about our agency working model —the “Heist”model— at [an upcoming Hybrid Talks](http://www.hybrid-plattform.org/index.php/de/veranstaltungen/hybrid-talks/68?view=item).

Talking about copyright, on Wednesday the Pirate Party [hit 13% in a national poll](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4214651,00.html). I'm also going to [present about open transit data](http://gruene-berlin.de/termine/open-data-und-mobilit%C3%A4t) in the Abgeordnetehaus Berlin alongside Stefan Wehrmeyer and other notables on an invitation by the Greens.

At the end of the week I went to DAM to see the Blind Sequence Trust exposition by Joan Leandre. I [wrote about my impressions](/dingen/2012/04/blind-sequence-trust/) of that exposition which is very much recommended seeing.

I also wrote quite a bit about theater that week it seems. A piece about what you [should see in the Schaubühne](/dingen/2012/04/what-the-schaubuhne-is-about/) and a piece about [the German/Dutch theater debate](/dingen/2012/04/a-dutch-theater-debate-in-berlin/) I attended at the Deutsches Theater some time ago.

I also fixedbetter Tijs's version of [the Anobii to GoodReads exporter](https://github.com/alper/Anobii2Goodreads) and moved my books over there where [you can find my reading](http://www.goodreads.com/alper). And I wrote [a bit about how Jan Chipchase's experiment](/dingen/2012/04/designing-in-the-face-of-defeat/) pertains to the design of withdrawn objects.

The end of the week was marked by an impromptu visit by [prof. Scheiber](https://twitter.com/#!/wearetrimtab) to Berlin which was celebrated with pints of Augustiner and Korean food.
