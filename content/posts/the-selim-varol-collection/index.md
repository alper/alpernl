Last Saturday I made it out to the penultimate day of the exhibition of the [Selim Varol](https://twitter.com/www_toykio_com) Collection in the [me collectors room](http://www.me-berlin.com/) here in Berlin. I'm glad I did. This was one of the most complete and stunning collections of contemporary toys and subversive art on display anywhere.

Most of the fun is in the sheer completionism of certain walls and cabinets. Acquiring everything past the point of simple fun. Add to that trying to recognize what everything is about, what the references and twists in the various works are.

What adds to the power of a well done private collection such as this one is its lack of fear. It doesn't need to be backed up artistically, there's no curator hedging their bets or trying to cultivate relations, it isn't afraid not to be taken for full and in short: it isn't uptight (modern art take note).
