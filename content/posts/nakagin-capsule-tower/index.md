Yesterday I saw the documentary on the [Nakagin Capsule Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakagin_Capsule_Tower) by Rima Yamazaki as part of [the DOKU.ARTS festival](http://doku-arts.de/2015/en/programme/2015/Nakagin-Capsule-Tower) here in Berlin. I wasn't aware of this landmark during my last visit to Tokyo though I must have passed close by while cycling through the city. I'll make a point to see [it](https://foursquare.com/v/%E4%B8%AD%E9%8A%80%E3%82%AB%E3%83%97%E3%82%BB%E3%83%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%93%E3%83%AB/4b6c188bf964a520a3232ce3) when next I visit if it still stands because that is exactly the topic of the documentary.

The tower is a prime example of [Metabolist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism_(architecture)) architecture by Kisho Kurokawa. Metabolism is a hard to define but influential strand of architecture that is described in the documentary as an architecture without timelag. It turns out that the tower by now, though charming with its tiny rooms, is outdated and unmaintainable. Most of the owners want to tear it down and have something new built there that makes more economic sense. Among architects and historians there are voices for preserving it as a monument to an important movement in Japanese architecture and other who think it could indeed be torn down.

The main reason why I wanted to see this movie is because next week I'm moving into a building in Berlin designed by a metabolist architect [Arata Isozaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arata_Isozaki). He appears in the movie as a member of the metabolist movement and as an proponent of conservation. I found his reasoning to be somewhat incoherent and overly sentimental. I'm not sure what that means for the building I will be living in but we'll see. I've only been there once, but I absolutely love the building pictured above. Time will tell whether that is justified.

Another architect [Toyo Ito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyo_Ito) who expressed a disillusionment with metabolism was in favor of tearing it down. His reasoning is that buildings just like people are finite and that if they have fulfilled their purpose they should be allowed to disappear to be replaced by something new. This is a way of thinking about architecture that is mostly alien if you live in Europe but that I find to be extremely refreshing. I think our local hangups on history and current efforts to [construct buildings in a historicized fashion](http://berliner-schloss.de/en) are morbid but this is the way we do things in Europe.

All along during the documentary I had to think about some William Gibson I read about Tokyo but which I cannot find right now. So instead I'll post this from [My Own Private Tokyo](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/9.09/gibson.html) that I came across.

> The Japanese, you see, have been repeatedly drop-kicked, ever further down the timeline, by serial national traumata of quite unthinkable weirdness, by 150 years of deep, almost constant, change. The 20th century, for Japan, was like a ride on a rocket sled, with successive bundles of fuel igniting spontaneously, one after another.
