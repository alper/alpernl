Nice to see Amos creating his own Rust open source cinematic universe with advances in a wide area of topics. It's refreshing to see somebody be skilled at something and then deploying that skill with abandon like here.

Many of these are real problems and they are of interest to me as well. I tried out Zola in my search for a static site generator. Buck2 is on my list of things to try out but I've been forewarned against it because of the reasons listed here. Rust compilation times are still quite awful.

That's what you'll see if you delve into any project. Everything is shallow and there's so much that's still wide open for anybody to contribute to.
