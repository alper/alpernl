I was reading this [article on the future of web technology](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-futhtml1/?ca=dgr-lnxw01FutureHTML). It gives a good overview of the current state of technology, future directions and a two way consolidation which I hope is going to take place.

On one hand the standards will mature to capture the current needs of application developers and the browser developers (save IE of course) will move ahead with new functionality.

On the other hand the toolkit builders will use whatever is available right now to create some sane baseline to develop against. I got my [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) to play with [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.com/) last night.

SVG support is all over the map and is now even bleeding into Canvas if you see this arguably [impressive demonstration](http://fuchsia-design.com/CanvaSVG/) (and especially the [tiger](http://fuchsia-design.com/CanvaSVG/Tests/Tiger.xml)).
