Besides [the immense amount of things](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2013/02/week-181/) we did over at Hubbub last week, I also spent a lot of time doing various other things which sort of amazed me to be honest.

[![Giving this another go with my improved German skills #digiges](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8217/8448704140_fdd14b369d.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8448704140/ "Giving this another go with my improved German skills #digiges by illustir, on Flickr")

Tuesday I went to [the Netzpolitische Abend here in c-base](https://netzpolitik.org/2013/digiges-abend-leistungsschutzrecht-eu-datenschutzreform-freifunk-storerhaftung/) where [Janneke Slöetjes](https://www.bof.nl/2012/02/10/we-stellen-je-graag-voor-aan-janneke-sloetjes/) of Bits of Freedom was one of the speakers. It was great fun catching up with what they've been busy with and the activist's life.

And on Saturday Jan Lehnardt and I organized the first [Swhack Berlin](http://janl.github.com/swhack-berlin/), a commemorative hackathon to do the things that we would normally only talk about. A round-up of the things we did is still forthcoming, but everybody is super-busy of course. It was a lot of fun and I was pleasantly surprised even by the 10+ people who showed up and got busy. We'll do another one sometime in the near future.
