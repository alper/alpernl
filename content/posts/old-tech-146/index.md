I got a hold of Felix of [Plazes](http://www.plazes.com) here at [Reboot](http://reboot.dk) and showed him the new incarnation of my Dashboard Widget. The new version performs a different (arguable) more useful function and should suck a bit less.

It should also sport some decent artwork instead of the mess it is right now as soon as [Cristiano](http://cbetta.blogspot.com/) gets around to making some.

Hooking in on that, Felix showed me the upcoming new version of Plazes which indeed looks very cool. New icons and other graphics on the maps, better search, a better API and statistics.

The new site has a stat listing the average amount of kilometers you have travelled based on the plazes you log in on. Word has it that [Joi Ito](http://joi.ito.com) travels an average 1500km each day.
