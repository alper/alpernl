The [feature list for KDE 4](http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/02/07/2059202&from=rss) is pretty impressive and is a nice pre-emption of Vista. They are both adding a slew of necessary features and innovating around a number of areas.

I can't help but get the feeling that the Gnome desktop —though clean— is lagging behind KDE in sheer feature richness. Though I haven't run a recent SUSE Linux Desktop with all the whistles and bells yet. Debian/Testing tends to be a bit spartan.
