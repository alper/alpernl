As an occasional listener to the various Asymco podcasts and somebody very much interested in new forms of mobility, I was taken more than a bit aback by this.

Dediu revealed himself as a founder in Bond which is the same company as Smide. I remembered him having somebody from Smide on in [one of the first episodes of the Micromobility podcast](https://micromobility.io/podcast/6-premium-bikesharing-with-corinne-vogel-of-smide) but there was never any disclosure then or after about Dediu's connections there.

A lapse in disclosure and some backroom action is not a big deal and nothing much seems to have come from this, but it is a good reminder that everything you see online (not just the posts on Instagram) is fake.
