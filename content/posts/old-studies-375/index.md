To finalize the topic of my Masters Thesis, I planned a meeting with my two sponsors. These are the people that will be in the commission judging the work I have done.

The issue is that there currently exists some vagueness about [the precise topic](http://82.156.122.105/wiki/index.php/Thesis_Proposal) of my Masters and the research questions that I am going to pursue. On that meeting the plan is to stamp out these issues.

My first sponsor is [Jeroen van den Hoven](http://www.fil.tbm.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=eca06fab-9a8c-4ad9-9060-c14fc720f292&lang=en) from the department of [Technology, Policy and Management](http://www.tbm.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=f4145950-c485-44fc-b01e-ad9d03bebbb6&lang=en) where I am currently taking a couple of courses. That department is doing a lot of interesting work in societal implications of ICT.

My second sponsor is [Charles van der Mast](http://mmi.tudelft.nl/~charles/) from the department of [Media and Knowledge Engineering](http://scholieren.ewi.tudelft.nl/mkt/). He is a well known teacher of my department and I already have taken several courses by him. His field of expertise is closest to the subject I want to investigate.

Now to prepare for this meeting…
