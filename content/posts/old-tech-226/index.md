Just did a fresh [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) install for [last.tv](http://lasttv.aardverschuiving.com/news/) and man! those guys keep up the good work.

Thing that really caught my attention was the seemless skin picker. Changing your templates could not really be easier (it could be a bit faster).

I was thinking of writing my own search for my next iteration site, but I'm really not relishing the idea of writing Yet Another Blog and having to maintain it. Especially not when there is such a fantastic offering such as Wordpress is readily available.
