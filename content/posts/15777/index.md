A very revealing article about the liquidation wave in the Netherlands of the past years. Some of the interesting points:

- Things started going off after the police decided not to spend too much attention on victimless crimes (drugs) anymore. This allowed the drug trade (mostly cocaine) to get out of hand without too many people noticing it.
- A lot of kids are at risk to roll into this world because they have a bad start, problems at home and at school and they want the fast money that crime offers.
- The people you see driving around the big cars or on Instagram have probably never had a regular job in their life.
- One way for a kid to make headway into the organization (and also financially) is by doing a hit which nets around €50-60k.
