And to finish off the week, yesterday evening we had a nice ride through Rotterdam during the alleycat. I'd never done the Maastunnel before, nor seen most of Zuid, the Cuyp and the Brienenoord on bike before, so it was a great day of discovering Rotterdam.

Unfortunately no pictures of glorious Rotterdam during the golden hour as I crossed the Erasmus bridge for the last leg of the race. Too busy biking.
