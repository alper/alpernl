> The Spaniards are good at many things, but not at making war. All foreigners alike are appalled by their inefficiency, above all their maddening unpunctuality.

> for some reason all the best matadors were Fascists.

> When a man refused to obey an order you did not immediately get him punished; you first appealed to him in the name of comradeship. Cynical people with no experience of handling men will say instantly that this would never 'work', but as a matter of fact it does 'work' in the long run.

> It was not till late March that I saw a bomb worth throwing.

> I admit I was amazed and scandalized when I first saw it done. The idea of trying to convert your enemy instead of shooting him! I now think that from any point of view it was a legitimate manoeuvre.

> Actually churches were pillaged everywhere and as a matter of course, because it was perfectly well understood that the Spanish Church was part of the capitalist racket.

> This alliance, known as the Popular Front, is in essential an alliance of enemies, and it seems probable that it must always end by one partner swallowing the other.

> The Anarchists were the opposite of the majority of so-called revolutionaries in so much that though their principles were rather vague their hatred of privilege and injustice was perfectly genuine.

> The Communist's emphasis is always on centralism and efficiency, the Anarchist's on liberty and equality.

> When I joined the militia I had promised myself to kill one Fascist--after all, if each of us killed one they would soon be extinct--and I had killed nobody yet, had hardly had the chance to do so.

> If there is one thing I hate more than another it is a rat running over me in the darkness.

> I have felt exactly the same thing when stalking a wild animal; the same agonized desire to get within range, the same dreamlike certainty that it is impossible.

> Many of the normal motives of civilized life--snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.--had simply ceased to exist.

> And, after all, instead of disillusioning me it deeply attracted me. The effect was to make my desire to see Socialism established much more actual than it had been before. Partly, perhaps, this was due to the good luck of being among Spaniards, who, with their innate decency and their ever-present Anarchist tinge, would make even the opening stages of Socialism tolerable if they had the chance.

> A fat man eating quails while children are begging for bread is a disgusting sight, but you are less likely to see it when you are within sound of the guns.

> It is a horrible thing to have to enter into the details of inter-party polemics; it is like diving into a cesspool.

> There are occasions when it pays better to fight and be beaten than not to fight at all.

> Anyone who has served in Spain knows that the one operation of war that Spaniards really perform really well is that of feeding their troops.

> Since 1930 the Fascists had won all the victories; it was time they got a beating, it hardly mattered from whom.

> My second was a violent resentment at having to leave this world which, when all is said and done, suits me so well.

> To be killed in battle-- yes, that is what one expects; but to be flung into jail, not even for any imaginary offence, but simply owing to dull blind spite, and then left to die in solitude--that is a different matter.

> I have the most evil memories of Spain, but I have very few bad memories of Spaniards. I only twice remember even being seriously angry with a Spaniard, and on each occasion, when I look back, I believe I was in the wrong myself.
