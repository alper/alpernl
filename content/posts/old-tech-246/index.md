As was mentioned earlier and has been due for something close to a year this blog is closing in its current form and moving on.

During the course of this night I will be changing the A-record of [alper.nl](http://alper.nl) to point to the new setup I have built on [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com). From then on I will resume improving the content I have hosted on this domain.

The change this blog will see is that its content will be made static and linked into an index page. Not too user friendly, but it is meant for Google indexing and most visitors of my old posts come through Google anyway.

The current setup I have with Zope running on an ailing computer on my home machine was becoming more and more untenable. The hardware failings were bothersome but solvable.

The real problem lied with the [Zope](http://www.zope.org/) platform. It seemed like a good idea to host a blog on it because ‘I was going to learn it’. I never got around to learning it properly. Zope is a fine product, it is too obscure and big for my taste.

Most comprehensive CMSes are written in [PHP](http://php.net) and in the Python space [Django](http://djangoproject.com) is just so much the more compelling for me. With platforms the size really is one of the most important reasons to choose one over the other (I think [James Governor](http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/) keeps saying this).

Maintaining a blog an a —for me— dead-end hard to host platform was becoming very unattractive what with a very nice competing offering: [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org).

English language blogging about all things technology, education and design related will continue on our newly started initiative [Four Starters](http://fourstarters.com). Feeds for this blog will be redirected permanently to [http://fourstarters.com/feed](http://fourstarters.com/feed) so if all goes well, this change would not affect you much.
