I thought [I had problems with my Instagram account](/dingen/2020/08/losing-firstname-on-instagram/). Turns out it can be a lot worse than that.

I found out that there is a large secondary market where Facebook employees sell support and verification status to whoever can pay, but being able to commission an account to be stolen straight up is pretty extreme.

Turns out this guy got so much attention for his case that he got his account returned promptly but in the thread there are a bunch more people who are facing similar issues.
