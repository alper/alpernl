I may be a newly found Mac user but my main pc is still running Linux (if I turn it on) and I still see that platform as having a future.

For the Dutch Linux users (=enthousiasts) there is a [Linux Meeting](http://www.linux-bijeenkomst.nl/) this Saturday. For some strange reason it is located in Tiel, but it may just be worth the trip. The [programme for the day](http://www.linux-bijeenkomst.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=28) looks interesting and it is a good opportunity to meet likeminded individuals.

Depending on how this week develops (and if they have conference WiFi) I will be there. If you're also coming, please make a comment to this post.
