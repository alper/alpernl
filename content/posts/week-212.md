There is a vibe floating around at [the office](http://twitter.com/ouroffice) about studio++. I have had lots of ideas, visions, hopes and ambitions for the future studio, but most importantly: it should be similarly (de)central, be about twice as big and we should have a full kitchen to our disposal. Too much to ask for in Amsterdam's slumping professional real estate market? I think not. The search starts in earnest sometime after I move house this weekend.

Finalizing _maguro_, doing onsite work with [Kilian Valkhof](http://www.kilianvalkhof.com) on Statlas, talking with old school publishers, putting the final touches on _mérida_.

And in between all of this, trying to produce some original writing on the subject of games.

Also I cannot stress how instrumental the lovely guys at [the Village](http://thevillagecoffee.nl/) in Utrecht are for keeping us caffeinated (and by extension sanely productive):
