This was a short week. Work on [Apps voor Nederland](http://appsvoornederland.nl) and then off to [Playful](http://thisisplayful.com/).

Nice to see that Peter Robinett is running AMStransit in his office on a spare screen:

Hack de Overheid announced [Code Camping Amsterdam](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/2011/10/code-camping-amsterdam/) which is going to be our biggest event yet in a derelict office across the IJ in Amsterdam. Everything is in full effect to organize that.

Playful was great and it's always nice to be in London for a short stretch. It was a while that I was [last in Conway Hall](http://www.geekyoto.com/) but it was nice to be back. Niels and Kars have written detailed accounts about the day on [Hubbub](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2011/10/occupy-the-future-at-playful-2011/) and [Bashers](http://bashers.nl/waar-is-mijn-death-star).

Then in the same weekend (flying into Schiphol in the morning, directly in the car to Germany) it was off to the Ruhrgebiet in Germany to visit among others the Jahrhunderthallen and the Landschaftspark Duisburg-Nord.
