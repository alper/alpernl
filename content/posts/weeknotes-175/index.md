A quick one.

PLAY Pilots (née project _ebi_) is revving up for [its public launch](http://twitter.com/whatsthehubbub/status/19353912679) follow [@playpilots](http://twitter.com/playpilots) for news about that. Lots of work going into that, lots more to do still.

Noteworthy other stuff:

The first pilot game is going to be awesome and the second one probably is too. Read more about those on [the blog](http://blog.playpilots.nl/).

I met with René Wansdronck an architect about geographical plotting of objects.

Also project _nezahualcoyotl_ got its go ahead. Something to do with a hardware manufacturer and the quantified self, should be great. Going to take place in the course of August.
