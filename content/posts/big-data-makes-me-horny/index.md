Today at an event called ‘What makes you horny?’ ( [#wmyh](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23wmyh)), I gave a presentation about my inspiration: Big Data.

[What Makes You Horny? Big Data!](http://www.slideshare.net/alper/wmyh-publishable-key "What Makes You Horny? Big Data!")

Data coupled with Design is more or less my field of choice, my work and passion.

This is the same thinking that is behind my proposition that websites are not the most important thing online anymore. Websites are important in so far as they get data and facilitate interaction on that data, but both of those are taking place more and more on completely different locations. It is far more useful to think of the web as streams of data and actors that interact with that data.

The talk was well received though (as always) it stands to be improved greatly under the influences of feedback and ripening.

**Update:** This presentation is now in Slideshare's top presentations of the day.
