I [heard Plazes](http://blog.leapfrog.nl/archives/2006/03/30/plazes-can-make-you-famous/) can make you famous, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.

It is actually pretty cool and has a client for Mac and GPS support for the Netherlands. I now have a [user account](http://beta.plazes.com/user/20de92bc1c62ef0ce74570ed073acc59/) and have just created [my home](http://beta.plazes.com/plaze/f4f84c365cb2adfaa3f284a61b6e09f1/) as a Plaze.

I have to claim some more Plazes tomorrow and then you can track my whereabouts either via the Plazes site or using the badge on my [blog main page](http://alper.nl/blog/alper).

**Update:** I can't use it on my work because the Plazer does not understand my proxy settings. Bummer.
