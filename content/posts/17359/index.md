Late to the party but I very much love this interview with Karri Saarinen, the co-founder of Linear. Their way of working, "The Linear Method", will be waved away by companies ("we can't do that because…") but with leadership with the right mentality and experience I don't think it's that far off at all. Ask your leadership how you can work like this.

Also I already know I'm going to use the term "side quest" a lot.

We don't use Linear but we recently moved all our stuff from Jira to Github Projects which—even though it is mostly abandoned—is Linear-enough.

Most importantly, it is right on top of our codebase which is where I believe all engineering work should happen anyway.
