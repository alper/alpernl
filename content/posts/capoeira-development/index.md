A weekend with friends for me only reaches conclusion after the pictures have been edited and placed online. The process takes some time but also allows/forces me to relive it. This time the process has been further prolonged because I have to wait until somewhere next week to pick up my developed film.

Last weekend in [Wapse](http://maps.google.nl/maps?f=q&hl=nl&geocode=&q=Wapse&sll=52.469397,5.509644&sspn=1.807083,3.856201&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=13&iwloc=addr) with friends was quite awesome, here are some stills:
