Not so much a game as it is a parkour simulator with some combat thrown in. It is absurdly difficult which isn't even the problem. The real problem is that every time you restart it takes too long and puts you in a place where you have to replay large segments of the game. This may be fun for some but not for me.

I'm also not convinced that it is useful to have a parkour simulator where you don't see where your feet are and as such cannot time your jump really. There are better parkour games out there (Assassin's Creed II comes to mind).

The aesthetics of the game are special and that is more or less the only reason I was told to play this game.
