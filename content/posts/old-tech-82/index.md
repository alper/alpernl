[Great presentation](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2006/02/my_future_of_web_apps_slides.shtml) ([PDF](http://www.plasticbag.org/files/native/native_to_a_web_of_data.pdf)) by Tom Coates of Yahoo! A nice big collection of Web 2.0 concepts and ideas. I especially love the style of presenting.

Big holes in the slides, but I imagine it must have come over quite well in the room.
