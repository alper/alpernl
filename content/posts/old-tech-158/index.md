I now have a new Macbook from which I am blogging this.

The experience is quite good. The thing is a great toy and performancy is excellent. OS X is positively snappy.

The only grip I have about it is that I have a case of [the squishy button](http://ibloggedthis.com/2006/06/29/an-origami-solution-to-the-apple-macbook-trackpad-squishy-button-problem/).

There probably is no such thing as the perfect experience, but I'm interested in if Apple and its resellers will pick this up in a decent way. Will keep you posted.

I just called the store and got duely patronized. They of course will not take my word and have to look at it themselves. Fair enough. The patronization was somewhat out of place though it is a common feature in all Dutch retail.
