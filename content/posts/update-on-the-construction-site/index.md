title: Update on the construction site
url: /dingen/2021/12/update-on-the-construction-site/

---
The [construction site next](/dingen/2021/11/chasing-down-noise-complaints-for-the-construction-site-next-to-our-house/) to our house is still spewing forth noise and fumes at all hours. The city is unable to do anything here it seems and calling the people at the construction site we are met with nothing but deflection and lies.

They have built a housing around the heater which has maybe reduced the noise by 5dB and we are still left with a value that is far above what is allowed here.

Picture of the housing forthcoming.
