It looks like the past period of turbulent ascent is over and the plane is going to be level for a bit. That does not mean that there isn't an awful lot of awesome stuff on deck waiting to be published nor that there aren't a bunch of new prospects on the horizon. More on those in due time.

Lots of work this week on [Statlas](http://statlas.nl) also a bunch for the [Groene Amsterdammer](http://www.groene.nl). _Maguro_ got finished with a large scale finale event which they tell me was all the rage. Also our work on _acapulco_ got finished, pictures for which are due soon.

Visited [Mobile Monday](http://www.mobilemonday.nl). Prepared various proposals to do work on the border between computer science and architecture.

Also our friends from [the Village](http://thevillagecoffee.nl/) in Utrecht opened their coffee store. Needless to say a lot of the work we do over there is fueled by quality caffeine and we will be paying them more than regular visits. I suggest you do the same.

Friday we of course also had our regular drinks at [@ouroffice](http://twitter.com/ouroffice). You are welcome for any of our next installations.

And as if the week was not filled enough with highlights, I also got to play my role as the [Design Misanthrope](http://twitter.com/dmisanthrope):
