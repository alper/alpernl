I don't think I disagree with anything Craig Mod writes.

In his: [“Books in the age of the iPad”](http://craigmod.com/journal/ipad_and_books/) he argues succinctly for the abolishment of most printed books in favor of those that are properly designed for the medium.

I myself am going to get rid of all of my books save the design, poetry and photography ones. Because:

> The convenience of digital text — on demand, lightweight (in file size and physicality), searchable — already far trumps that of traditional printed matter.

It's good that most people haven't caught on to that yet. It gives me time to get rid of my book collection before the perceived value of printed paper plummets through the floor.
