Last week was mostly busy with getting [http://playpilots.nl](http://playpilots.nl/) to talk nicely to [the Stereoscoop](http://playpilots.nl/games/de-stereoscoop/) live game and make stuff work (mostly) properly back and forth. Synchronizing physical installations with websites is always fun.

Monday we also saw the launch of [Stweetfightr](http://stweetfightr.com/), a game by the friendly people from [Carsonified](http://carsonified.com/). The mechanic is mostly the same as [PLAY Pilots](http://playpilots.nl), with roles, moves and turn taking except that theirs is resolved by a straight roshambo mechanic (one which we considered, but rejected).

Monday I also attended [the first meetup](http://www.kk.org/quantifiedself/2010/09/amsterdam-qs-meetup-recap-1.php) of the Quantified Self Amsterdam chapter co-organized by our office's [Maarten den Braber](http://twitter.com/mdbraber).

The second half of this week was taken up mostly by [PICNIC](http://www.picnicnetwork.org) which was a great event again. Criticism aside, Amsterdam should celebrate a cross-over event such as this that combines various disciplines and gets so many luminaries to coalesce within its borders. The conference was great and even better the catching up with various people from across the world.

Friday [the Stereoscoop](http://playpilots.nl/games/de-stereoscoop/) was launched oficially at [the Dutch Film Festival](http://filmfestival.nl). I unfortunately could not attend this because I was organizing [the first Dutch Data Drinks](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2010/09/dutch-data-drinks-1/) for [Monster Swell](http://monsterswell.com). A resounding succes and the first of many events focused on the coming Big Data trend.

Friday our friends from the Utrechts Uitburo also launched their [integration with Foursquare](http://foursquare.com/utrechtsuitburo) (the first in the Netherlands), something which has been a long time in the making.

PICNIC taking a large bite out of the week's productivity, the weekend suffered (in a good way).

On Saturday I sat on the terrace of [Two for Joy](http://foursquare.com/venue/5100253) catching the last rays of the sun, while sketching out a concept model for an ethnographical study of metropolitan minorities in the Netherlands with regards to digital services and informal economy.
This was partly prompted by the Urban Lenses panel at [PICNIC](http://picnicnetwork.org) where certain panelists displayed an inexcusable amount of cultural insensitivity and simplistic thinking. This is a tendency among many of our colleagues to see their affluent, technologically able, privileged selfs as the model for which to design. Not to mention to see the disconnect between the nation's policies and its ethnically diverse periphery high streets.
I propose going into these burbs and talking to these people to see what their lives are really like and how they use technology. Think [Jan Chipchase](http://www.janchipchase.com) but without the [permafuck](http://janchipchase.com/?s=permaphuck) ((Don't worry, you will get tired plenty.)). A project for fun, but I can't guarantee we won't make any profit. Up for it?

You may have noticed the transition of [Monster Swell](http://monsterswell.com) from a static placeholder site to a full [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) installation of its own. That is the first improvement on that domain for it to become a fully scalable information consuming and producing entity. How that will impact this weblog remains to be seen.

Sunday was occupied by taking the Urbanode integration at the [Melkweg](http://www.melkweg.nl) to a next step and learning more and more about lighting systems. Also project _mérida_ started with some custom django deployment more on which later.
