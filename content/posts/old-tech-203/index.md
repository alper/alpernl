See [Joi Ito on the adoption](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/10/28/meeting_ivailo_kalfin.html) of [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org) licenses by the Foreign Ministry of Bulgaria. Join this with a very forward and open attitude towards ICT and policy and these guys will be kicking our asses.

Why doesn't the Netherlands follow Bulgaria and Brasil and make innovative ICT initiatives not the subsidized afterthought they are currently but a spearhead of policy?

The short and simple answer is the huge amount of vested interest in the Netherlands in non-ICT —all old economies— and in dead-ICT —i.e. temp consulting and the like. Pair this with a lack of guts to make significant choices and you risk becoming a stagnant backwater.
