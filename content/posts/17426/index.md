> Even as the world has caught up with him, Finkelstein remains most comfortable on the margins — ideologically aligned with a left that won’t always have him, platformed by a right that won’t always listen, and insulting them both.

> Yet Finkelstein is ambivalent about being pressed back into the cause and sympathetic to younger generations’ relative lack of interest in “old fogies.”“I recognize,”he said, “that it is your moment, it’s not my moment.”

A pretty fair profile of a man who's a polarizing character.
