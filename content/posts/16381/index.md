> **Barrels take initiative.** They don't wait for approval or consensus.  
**Barrels ship high-quality work.** They constantly looking for ways to improve.  
**Barrels value speed.** They get the proof of concept out the door quickly and iterate on it.  
**Barrels take accountability.** They are not only willing but excited to own the plan and the outcome.  
**Barrels are seen as a resource.** Teammates frequently seek them out for help and advice.  
**Barrels work well with others.** They know how to motivate teams and individuals alike.  
**Barrels can handle adversity.** They push through friction and obstacles.

I keep thinking of this model that contrasts between barrels—“someone who can take an idea from conception to live and it’s almost perfect”—and ammunition.

Try to become a barrel. It's a lot more fun.
