Seeing this presentation in Amsterdam as the culmination of [Mobile Monday](http://www.mobilemonday.nl/), was something great. The far reaching vision and reality based optimism Kevin Slavin lays down ( [his comments](http://slavin.tumblr.com/post/6034597315/does-augmented-reality-deserve-to-be-killed)) are something we should aspire to. It is worth watching and watching again.

Some choice quotes, though we should just hope that he finishes that essay:

> Reality is augmented not when it looks different but when it feels different.

> Maybe the aspiration to 3D optical AR starts to feel a little bit like pornography. Like a thin veneer of the actual experience that is flattened for the eye, that's rendered for the eye which is the one sense most easily fooled to begin with.

> Nobody knew better than me and the other people in that room that this was just computer code but it felt like a spirit had moved through the room and knocked all these phones off the table.

> For pilots there is no reality except the one right in front of them.

> Singular focus in which the eye is looking at rather than around. It diminishes reality. It closes it down. Because as it turns out for the driver as for most everybody here, reality is understood to be the whole world around us, not just that thing in front of us.

> They're inventing new ways to see, rather than new things to look at. And rather than inventing new places to go, they are inventing kind of new ways to travel. Because the whole thing is there's no shortage of stuff in the world and things to see and enjoy. Reality is plenty, thanks.
