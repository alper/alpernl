I'm really into the series [Da Vinci's Demons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci's_Demons) right now (thanks to [Kevin Slavin](http://slavin.tumblr.com/post/95973919823/dolly-snow-da-vincis-demons-season-1)) which is a light hearted affair for the off season when there's no Game of Thrones, True Detective or Sherlock.

{{< youtube id="vgg9nnALFGA" >}}

The trailer for the first season is kinda messed up, try [the one for season two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFpk2zzqCfU) otherwise.

I had been clamoring for Game of Thrones inspired historical fiction for a while now. There are lots of dark nooks of history which with a decent treatment could excite large audiences. So many topics to choose from but how about an epic series on [Khublai Khan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kublai_Khan) or about [Charlemagne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne)?

With Da Vinci's Demons this is becoming reality at least for [Leonardo da Vinci's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci) life in Florence. This Italian city and the papal intrigue of its time proves to be a great backdrop for an occult story set around this artist/engineer/inventor. The drawn overlays are a bit reminiscent of Sherlock and the premise of Da Vinci creating outrageous contraptions in no time at all is a lot like [MacGyver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver) ((I must have seen every episode of MacGyver a couple of times.)). Its anachronistic depiction and juiciness are like Game of Thrones though people in da Vinci's world seem even more cruel. In its depiction of a young incarnation of a well-known figure it even reminds me of [Young Indiana Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Indiana_Jones_Chronicles). Maybe there's even a bit of Dan Brown in there but I wouldn't know because I don't touch that crap.

As a series it may be too trivial to function as a social status signifier ((Which is I believe an important function of the diversion of cultural attention to series and podcasts currently among a certain group people. I opt out by NOT watching House of Cards or Mad Men but instead watching Generation Kill and Deadwood.)), but even its pulpiness has found its bearings after the first couple of episodes. The initially more evil characters are rounding out nicely with depth and conflicting interests of their own.

I was happily surprised to see that it has been renewed. After eight episodes in the first season there are at least two more seasons awaiting. Just by watching it I want to read more about Leonardo Da Vinci's life and go to Florence. History education has never been as fun and if this isn't the education, it's a great gateway drug.
