This is a very good framework from Matt Webb for organizations how to do strategic pathfinding when it comes to AI. In Germany especially, lots of orgs would benefit from doing this instead of whatever it is that they are busy with right now.

Interesting to see the word overhang used here (originally by Nat Friedman) which I normally use when talking about tech "debt" but a capability overhang is of course also possible.
