I usually enjoy Cortex's romps into productivity porn, but what struck me here is that they open with Grey discovering Asana and how he spent the week setting his business and life up in it.

Lots to unpack here:

People are still discovering Asana?

Grey immediately and deeply gets what is powerful about Asana and what tradeoffs that entails.

I think that everybody who refuses to use Asana is forced to cobble together a broken version of it themselves. That is true and will stay true.
