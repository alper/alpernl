Maandag [The Prophet](http://leb.net/gibran/works/prophet/prophet.html) van [Khalil Gibran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalil_Gibran) uitgelezen. Aardige teksten en immens quotebaar. Hier twee:

> And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy.

> For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill? Seek him always with hours to live.
