After using all kinds of note taking tools (eg. Notational Velocity) at some point some years ago I moved all my personal notes to Bear and it has been my secret productivity boost ever since.

I'm glad to see that they've held to the vision and didn't compromise to get Bear 2 just right. It can be difficult to pull something like that through.
