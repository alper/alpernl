A nice and quiet week in which I got a lot of stuff done that needed doing for a while.

I've been working on a personal transit app that has a different take on things than most apps. That has taken quite some time and attention but it is progressing rapidly. The state of open transit data around the world, however, is still disappointing.

I finished [the Prince of Networks](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6581757-prince-of-networks) and published [my notes](/dingen/2012/06/the-prince-of-networks-notes/) here as wel as [excerpts from an interview](/dingen/2012/06/an-interview-with-graham-harman/) with Harman.

On the other hand I am also putting the final touches on the game we're making for saba. That is coming along rapidly and we should be able to submit that to the App Store in the near future. It looks like I'm becoming something of an iOS programmer.

On Wednesday I visited the encampment near my office protesting the liberalization of rents and [wrote some thoughts](/dingen/2012/05/protests-on-kotti-against-rent-rises/) about that. Similar protests are going on where I live.

I also have gotten quite busy arranging stuff for [our upcoming Hack de Overheid in Amsterdam on June 16th](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/h-a-c-k-a-t-h-o-n-op-16-juni-in-de-smart-project-space/). I will be holding [a workshop demystifying programming](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/programmeren-kun-je-leren/) for people who don't know how to program yet. [You are very welcome to join us](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE9MSC1oa0laZjYtZGoxREgwbE1mZXc6MQ#gid=0) if also want to get your feet wet with code, data journalism or open data.

I also briefly [wrote up the launch of Politwoops in the USA](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/politwoops-live-voor-de-verenigde-staten/) with help from our friends from Sunlight.

My bicycle got a second brake which is a requirement in the highly responsible Germany. Talking about bicycles, I started [a Tumblr to document the miserably state of cycle paths in Berlin](http://berlinbikepaths.tumblr.com/).

Then it was also off to the Campus Party Housewarming Party and the day after the mediaboard of the region organized a [Gamersnet summer meeting](http://www.berlin.de/projektzukunft/english/newsarchiv/details/datum/2012/05/07/new-gamesnet-berlinbrandenburg/) in a videogame arcade lounge. The Berlin gaming scene is still rather nascent but there may be some potential here. The city is still too artist heavy and engineer thin which will need to change for more stuff to be built.

On Friday everything continued apace with a special anniversary visit to the local [Cafe CK](https://foursquare.com/v/ck-pour-voo/4db2e5ff6e8179a9135c651e) who are providing us with the only drinkable coffee within a literal mile.

The coming week it's off to Copenhagen for a brief visit to the European Data Forum (open data) and to the Metropolis Laboratory (urban games).
