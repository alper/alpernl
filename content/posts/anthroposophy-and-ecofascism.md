An in-depth study of the links between Nazism and Anthroposophy by Peter Staudenmaier at the Institute for Social Ecology with a lot of interesting bits in there.

> In fact Weleda supplied naturopathic materials for ‘medical experiments’ (i.e. torture) on prisoners at Dachau.

> Jazz and popular music are often scorned at European Waldorf schools, and recorded music in general is frowned upon; these phenomena are considered to harbor demonic forces. Instead students read fairy tales, a staple of Waldorf education. Some sports, too, are forbidden, and art instruction often rigidly follows Steiner’s eccentric theories of color and form. Taken together with the pervasive anti-technological and anti-scientific bias, the suspicion toward rational thought, and the occasional outbreaks of racist gibberish, these factors indicate that Waldorf schooling is as questionable as the other aspects of the anthroposophist enterprise.

And if you choose to follow the wikipedia trail lots more weird things, such as this guy: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentin\_Tomberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentin_Tomberg)

And lots of nazis and fellow travelers or intellectual precursors in there, like this guy:

> Karutz war ein deutscher HNO-Arzt und Ethnologe

That combination of professions is extremely sketchy. [German Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Karutz) neglects to mention this particular bit (weird how that keeps happening):

> Karutz was more openly antisemitic than many of his anthroposophist colleagues. He denounced the “spirit of Jewry,”which he described as “cliquish, petty, narrow-minded, rigidly tied to the past, devoted to dead conceptual knowledge and hungry for world power.”

Well worth a read and not so long as you would think. A lot of the page consists of notes and comments.
