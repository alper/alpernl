**Data Loss:** Yesterday after I came became from [LJS](http://www.ljs.nl) after resume all of my applications had frozen. They wouldn't work anymore even after killing.

After a reboot everything seemed back to normal but today I found out that my Addressbook had deleted everything. AddressBook.data.previous also was empty.

It's a good thing I could lift the file from my backup from a week ago. Let this be a lesson to you kids: [Make backups](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) and OS X will throw away your data for no reason.

**Front Row:** Yesterday at LJS I had also bought some missing pieces for my laptop. With the mini DVI-to-VGA converter I can hook my Macbook up to the bigger displays at my house.

I was duly disappointed when I saw that [Front Row](http://www.apple.com/imac/frontrow.html) still starts on my Macbook's screen. This is a stupid default, if there is a second screen attached to my Macbook Front Row should **always** display on that.

**Sleeve:** I am quite happy with my retro colored [Tucano sleeve](http://www.tucano.it/ENG/wcProductCard.asp?WCI=product_card&CardCode=GEN_ITA&ProductCode=BFGU-MB133-M), but it would have shown real care if the sleeve had also included a tiny compartment to put the remote in.
