I can't really get enough of Haidt takedowns like this one in the Guardian.

> The core irony of _The Coddling of the American_ _Mind_ is that, by opposing identity politics, its authors try to consolidate an identity that does not have to see itself as such. Enjoying the luxury of living free from discrimination and domination, they therefore insist that the crises moving young people to action are all in their heads.

> In their safe space of TED talks and [thinktanks](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/thinktanks) and think pieces, the genteel crusaders against “political correctness”create their own speech codes. As their constituency shrinks, their cant of progress starts to sound hysterical. The minds they coddle just may be their own.
