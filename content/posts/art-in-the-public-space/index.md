I started the week out nicely with a lunch lecture from Kie Ellens about art in the public space. It took me some time to properly code it, but it is online finally (and mostly in English):

The architectural student association [Stylos](http://www.stylos.nl/) is celebrating a lustrum this week, so there were lunch lectures every day, but unfortunately I could only attend the one.
