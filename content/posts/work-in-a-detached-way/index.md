Some stuff about [meditation and work by Chiara Cokieng](https://medium.com/@chiaracokieng/how-was-the-vipassana-course-my-response-e6f1f456f66c) that I find repeatedly useful so I'm putting it here for reference.

> People work because they crave. “Without craving, without attachment, how can anybody work?”Goenka’s students ask all the time.
>
> > Oh because you have not learned how to work in a detached way.
>
> Oh.
>
> > When you’re attached, you’re so tense inside, you’re so self-centered. I’m working for me. For me. For me. And once you become detached, all tension goes away. Now you work.
>
> Oh. Is that how you do it? Work? To do it in a detached way, not because you have to do something you desire or hate, but because you decided the work is worth doing? If I can do that, will I be able to do anything I say I will do, without any angst? Is that possible?
>
> I think I get it… If only barely.
>
> I still believe you shouldn’t spend your life slaving on something you hate. But I do believe in training, writing this article, waking up in the morning and being a good human being
