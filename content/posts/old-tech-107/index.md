Hurray for Google making up for all the shoddy work Microsoft has done on their browser. IE7 is coming out soon with a lot of fixes, but still not quite up to par with the rest of the civilized browser world.

[Ajaxian reports](http://ajaxian.com/archives/google-puts-the-canvas-in-ie) about a `<canvas>` implementation for IE so [stuff like this](http://www.zwitserloot.com/2006/03/22/bomberman-technology-preview/) will be cross browser.

**Update:** [The story](http://glenmurphy.com/blog/2006/03/explorercanvas.html) behind the project.
