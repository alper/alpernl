I am in awe.

I have a DVD ISO on my desktop PC and I was wondering how much trouble it was going to be to play that on my iBook. Very little to none, it seems.

- I can mount my $HOME on my desktop using smb:// and so I can read all my files there. This took me some time to set up because samba is a hassle. But once setup it is very easy (Command-K).

- The ISO I found waiting for me, could simply be double-clicked and it automatically mounted on my iBook. So I had an ISO mounted over smbfs.

- Then I started DVD Player and seeing the only place I had a DVD medium was on a mount (DVD drive empty) it started playing that without asking questions. Playback was over the network and very smooth.

So concerning [announcements of the new Mac Mini Media Center Edition](http://digg.com/apple/New_Mac_Mini_to_Take_Center_Stage_in_Your_Living_Room), will it work? Hell, yes!
