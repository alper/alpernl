Wanted to show the kids some chiaroscuro for their art class about light and dark tomorrow and ran through some of [the all time greats from Caravaggio](https://www.artrenewal.org/artists/caravaggio/589). They were particularly impressed by Holofernes being beheaded.

Always stunning to see how good these paintings are and a bit sad for how long it's been since I saw one for real. But [Sanssouci](https://www.spsg.de/en/palaces-gardens/object/picture-gallery-of-sanssouci) has the picture of Doubting Thomas so that can be fixed.
