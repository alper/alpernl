> Call birth, “birth,”and death, “death,”without seeing one as good and the other as evil and your children will be at home with life.

> If you teach them to achieve they will never be content.
>
> If you teach them contentment, they will naturally achieve everything.

> You do not live your life through your children.
>
> Therefore they are free to find their own true fulfillment.

> If you overly protect your children they will fear failure and avoid pain.
>
> But failure and pain are twin teachers of important lessons.
>
> Unless your children fully experience both how will they know they have nothing to fear?

> Parents who hide failure, deny loss, and berate themselves for weakness, have nothing to teach their children.
>
> But parents who reveal themselves, in all of their humanness, become heroes.
>
> For children look to these parents and learn to love themselves.

> Whatever they are doing, they are learning.
>
> And it is, for them, pure joy.

> All of your “God”words will not teach your children as much as will your nurture, and your love, and your cherishing.

> Help them instead to find the wonder and the marvel of an ordinary life.

> And make the ordinary come alive for them. The extraordinary will take care of itself.

> Don’t make parenting harder than it needs to be. It only requires focus.
>
> Worry is not focus.
>
> Attempting to control is not focus.
>
> Distracting yourself is not focus.
>
> Relaxed, non-fretful, attention to what is in front of you right now, is focus.

> If you take the bait the battle rages.
>
> Instead step back, breathe deeply, relax, and stay at your center.
>
> Battles require two parties.
>
> One fighting alone soon tires.

> A problem is not an interruption to a serene and happy life.
>
> A problem is an ordinary part of such a life.

> You do not have to make your children into wonderful people.
>
> You only have to remind them that they are wonderful people.

> But the Tao teaches that games are for fun, that business is for the common good, that no one wins at war, and that love endures for all.

> Every moment is a death of all that has gone before, and a birth of all that is to come.
