Last week was a week for some work in the Netherlands and some much deserved catchup with friends and colleagues over there.

On monday [the protocol of the meeting](http://dorfanger-blankenburg.de/cms/uploads/files/LAG_Mobi_Protokoll_mit_Anhang_2012-05-02.pdf) we had in the Berlin parliament about open transit data was published. It contains all the proceedings and slides.

On Tuesday I went to Hilversum to give a workshop on journalistic data visualization over there. It's always fun to give these and it's going to be even more fun to see the results coming out of it.

After that I bounced over to Utrecht to relax a bit in the Village. It had been too long ago and it's still the best coffee store in the Netherlands. After that I went to [Hubbub](http://hbbb.nl) headquarters for some future planning with Kars Alfrink.

On Wednesday we had a lot of stuff to do with [the (Open State) foundation](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/) (more on which later). That same evening we had a board meeting.

On Thursday I had a nice lunch with [Tim de Gier](http://timdegier.nl/) and finished my next game review for [the paper](http://nrcnext.nl).

This is the view from the Amsterdam office. Pure luxury for that city.

Also I had to buy the new book [“Koorddansen in de Kaukasus”](http://olafkoens.nl/2012/03/29/koorddansen-in-de-kaukasus/) by Olaf Koens about his adventures in the Caucasus. It is a fast paced collection of stories in this very bizarre part of the world.

I also managed to visit the newly opened [EYE movie institute](http://www.eyefilm.nl/) on the IJ shore. A beautiful building with a stunning view, heralding in a new era for this part of Amsterdam.

Next it was the train back to Berlin and prototypes for some new applications.
