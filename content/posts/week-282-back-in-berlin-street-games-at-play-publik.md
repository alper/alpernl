Last Monday was the end of the holiday with a leisurely train ride from Munich to Berlin during which I managed to chew through a lot of e-mails and revise a bunch of maths.

The rest of the week was spent mostly working through e-mails, meetings and social calls. [Netzpolitik](https://netzpolitik.org/) celebrated their birthday in C-Base with some nice drinks.

And rather quickly Kars Alfrink arrived in Berlin for [the Play Publik festival](http://playpublik.de/). You'll notice some similarities between my personal weeknotes and [the general Hubbub weeknotes for last week](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2012/08/week-156/).

[Virtueel Platform](http://virtueelplatform.nl/) published the videos of our talks in Helsinki, so there you have me talking about open data:

With our [Hubbub](http://hbbb.nl) strength over at the Berlin studio doubled on Wednesday we finished _saba_. After that it was straight on working on _buta_ all the while playing games at the festival.

On Friday I had another additional studio guest with [Sebastian Deterding](http://codingconduct.cc/). That was also the day that I experienced the beautiful [Our Broken Voice](http://playpublik.de/admin/events/our-broken-voice?locale=en) at Ostbahnhof.

The rest of the weekend was spent working on buta and playing games at [Play Publik](http://playpublik.de/) with nary a moment's rest in between. It was nice to be finally able to play [Starry Heavens](http://playpublik.de/admin/events/starry-heavens-evening-event?locale=en) by [Eric Zimmerman](http://ericzimmerman.com/). I and a lot of people had a lot of fun with [Hit Me](http://kahoabe.net/?portfolio=hit-me).

The final day there was a presentation by Kevin Slavin and we closed off the event with a massive game of [Charge of the Rubber Ball Brigade](http://playpublik.de/admin/events/charge-of-the-rubber-ball-brigade?locale=en). There are many awesome pictures online [over at Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/Playpublik/photos) (which is a shame).
