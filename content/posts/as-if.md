I've discovered a hilarious new Turkish comedy show called "Gibi" (translated to As If). The episodes revolve around a group of friends who get embroiled in absurdist situations and have very nasty but eloquent arguments with each other.

To me this gives off a very Seinfeld-like feeling with nasty people living in a nasty city talking about nasty things with each other. Not the touchy feely stuff that you see in normal sitcoms. You don't really quite get why these people hang out with each other but they do.

Below is the first episode in its entirety on YouTube where both main characters find themselves pressured to open a kebab shop. The rest of the series on [Exxen](https://www.exxen.com/tr) has passable English subs for anybody who would be interested.

I'm always a sucker for performances where people argue/fight with each other. The more fierce and physical the better. [Carnage](https://letterboxd.com/film/carnage/) is an old favourite of mine and the fight scene I witnessed in ['Langs de Grote Weg'](https://youtu.be/4Cu6f_lgic0?t=354) remains with me as one of the highlights of visiting Frascati.

I've watched a couple more episodes and I think I can say that the theme of the show is the weird social conformities that people in Turkey impose on each other. Hell is other people, especially over there.

## Exxen

To be able to watch the full series I took a month's subscription to Exxen. This seems to be one of a bunch of bespoke streaming platforms. Another one I was aware of through social media has been [Gain](https://www.gain.tv) (a self-described 'next generation content platform').

The Exxen website is kinda broken and the boss of the site has been quoted saying 'they are competing with Netflix.' That may be right, but Netflix is probably not competing with them. Still, with the 80M people living in Turkey, the substantial diaspora as well as people from other countries who consider Turkish culture and media to be aspirational (a lot more of those out there than you would think living in Europe), they probably can get by.

One weird déja-vu has been seeing many of the Turkish social media stars that I used to listen to on Clubhouse ( [Chaby](https://www.instagram.com/chabyhan/?hl=en), [Enis](https://www.instagram.com/enisarikan/?hl=en), [Zeynep](https://www.instagram.com/zeynepbastik/?hl=en)) make an appearance in weird and zany television formats exclusive to the platform. Most amazingly, those formats are also pretty professionally executed with high production values.
