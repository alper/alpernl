> Here or there, our blood will plant olive trees.

> Ours is a country of words: Talk. Talk.

> I ask: Is it true, good ladies and gentlemen, that the earth of Man is for all human beings as you say? In that case, where is my little cottage, and where am I?

> Can a people be born on a guillotine? We have the right to die any way we wish.

> In this hymn we lay a dream, we raise a victory sign, we hold a key to the last door, to lock ourselves in a dream.

> I gaze upon trees guarding the night from the night and the sleep of those who would wish me death.

> He used to arrive like a sword dipped in wine, and leave like the end of a prayer.

> And I died, I died utterly. How tranquil and peaceful is death without your crying? How tranquil and peaceful is death without your hands pounding on my chest to bring me back? Before and after death I loved you, and between I saw nothing but my mother’s face.
