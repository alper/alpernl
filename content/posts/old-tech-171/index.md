Apple has to think long and hard about openness when it becomes a lot less hassle for me to videochat with my friends using [Skype for Mac with Video Preview](http://www.skype.com/download/skype/macosx/videopreview.html) than it is with iChat.

For a Preview version the Skype product is pretty stable and works immediately. iChat locks you in in either .Mac or AOL which —seriously— nobody has. This while everybody all over the world on either Mac, Windows or Linux has Skype.

And the much touted three- or four-way [iChat AV](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat/) functionality was didn't really mesh when we tried it with three Macbooks where I work.

Thanks [eBay](http://www.ebay.com) for financing this nice product.
