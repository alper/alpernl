My friendly neighborhood night store will gladly give me a plastic bag for every item of shopping I buy from them ((As well they should if you see the markup they're charging.)). This is pretty thoughtful and at the same time also pretty short-sighted.
Now there seem to be some places in the world that have banned plastic bags though I'm not sure which ones. It is a pretty [contentious issue](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=plastic+bag+ban&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). It seems to be difficult or something but it's not exactly clear why that is. We're one of the technically most advanced societies in the world and we can't live without plastic bags?

I wasn't very hungry so instead of my regular döner I got some green pistachio baklava. This stuff is so ridiculously delicious it explodes into pure sugar and pistachio in your mouth and it fills you up pretty fast. I don't get why you would buy mass-produced candy from the supermarket. If you want to get fat, why not get fat eating good stuff?

Now if only I could find a place around here ((Den Haag or Rotterdam will do.)) that sells künefe, things would get really crazy.
