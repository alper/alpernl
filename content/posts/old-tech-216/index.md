When I was sitting in the train my Macbook became unusably unstable. Some stuff had already dight the night before, but it was still playing music and Safari was still running so I forwent the reboot.

I have been writing some stuff in WriteRoom recently and I was liking it a lot. It was also acting strange. Then it went ahead and **deleted all of my notes** except one.

Nice…
