A huge deep dive into how Stripe invests in technical infrastructure that contains too many good things to list.

> _Prioritize as much work into the future as possible, shedding "forced" work._

> _To start digging out, sometimes you can get creative, finding more leveraged approach, push on the constraints a few times to make sure you're not being rigid. The goal here is to find work that addresses "forced" work that also reduces future "forced" work._

> Consider getting product managers into your infrastructure organization. Not every team needs them all the time, but having even a few who can help navigate the transition from firefighting to innovating is super helpful.

> If your team is doing forced, short-term work, then dig out by investing into your operational excellence.
>
> If your team is just starting to experience the thrills of discretionary, long-term work, then invest into your product management skills.
>
> If you have discretionary budget, but still find yourself running from one problem, then identify the principles to balance your approach, and set baselines for each principle.
