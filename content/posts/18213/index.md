I could quote this entire article by [Dan North](https://dannorth.net):

> It takes daily resolve and good habits. It takes effort and deliberate practice to train yourself to ‘unsee’ the general case; to not reach for a library first ‘because it is only adding a single dependency’; to not prematurely abstract or DRY code because reasons; to not over-invest in a component because we have blanket coding standards with arbitrary rules like percentage of test coverage; to go back and stabilise that component you sketched to see if it would work, and it did; to excise that component you sketched that did not work out.

Building software this way is the perfect balance of freedom and discipline. As the author mentions it's a matter of taste and experience and extremely hard to learn in any other way than by doing it.

BSSN ( **Best** and **Simple** and **Now**) is the answer to "you should not build garbage" and "you should not overcomplicate your code prematurely" either.

Sketching in particular is a quality that should also apply to code (and will be impossible to explain to anybody who does not already get it).

> Sketching does not mean hacking! I know many more engineers who are good at ‘proper’ code than those who can sketch well. Sketching is about providing _just enough_ quality that you can sustain a direction, knowing you can go back and fill in the blanks later on (or throw away the sketch with minimal investment lost). Hacked code quickly becomes unmanageable. Well-sketched code is just a lighter-weight version of the real thing.
