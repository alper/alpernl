I read this paper right after I read the book by Piketty thinking that there would be some interesting economic debate. Unfortunately I was proved wrong and this seems to be exemplary of the stagnation of the economic field.

Most of my thinking on the paper has been confirmed by this post: http://glineq.blogspot.nl/2014/08/my-take-on-acemoglu-robinson-critique.html
