By the time you're reading this I will have flown off to the Levant to spend three weeks mainly in [Damascus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus), Syria.

Update frequency here and work/weeknotes will be very sparse depending on the weather and the network over there. Keep calm and carry on Get excited and start making things without me, I will be rejoining you on the 6th of November.
