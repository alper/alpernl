Lots of examples here by Intercom about how to enable teams to ship as fast as possible and at the same time also as safely as possible.

- Be available after shipping
- Ship instrumentation first
- Use feature flags
- Ship to a small subset of traffic
- Ship the "read" path first
- Document and share your plan and actions
