One of my bigger issues and the reason I'm not bought into the Nix ecosystem: If anything does not work (and many things *do* not work), you're going to be hours/days deep into various inscrutable abstractions, trying to fix it yourself.

The documentation is bad, everything is half done and mostly unused. The promise is great, but the reality not so much. That's why I say that Nix simply does not work for my definition of "work".

It's not a good fit, if you need to get stuff done which is why I reverted back to Homebrew.
