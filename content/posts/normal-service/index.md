Back from holiday, the surf was mostly flat but a good time was had, judging from the [pictures on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/) ((Still sorting through the bunch from Apremont and Nantes.)).

Normal service will resume here at least until half of August when I will break shortly for [Wapsen](http://www.dopplr.com/trip/alper/236146) and maybe thereafter a bit longer for the former Yugoslavia.
