Lots of props for the guys from [Fleck](http://www.fleck.com) for their brilliant gimmick for their launch at  [Techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/16/fleck-offers-zero-friction-web-annotation/). Wearing white suits and having people leave their details on you is sheer genius.

I took a quick look at the site and Fleck looks easy and fun enough to try out. Let's see.
