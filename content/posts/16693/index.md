That's a very astute observation of the state and culture of the Go programming language. I got out of Go way before I hit anything like this (though the Channel Axioms are something everybody is going to deal with). For me Go is a not very interesting intermediary language between Python and Rust.

In particular the crude simplicity is something that I always found suspect. It's the same you would hear from PHP programmers, "It works, doesn't it?" If getting something to work is such a feat that you can't or won't consider anything more than that, that's not an environment I want to work in.
