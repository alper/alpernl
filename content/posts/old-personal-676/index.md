Leuk [stuk bij The Guardian](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/culturevulture/archives/2006/08/01/i_bet_you_look.html) over keuze in boeken en hun aantrekkingskracht op mensen.

> Not only does sitting with your nose in a book positively influence others' opinion of you, it could actually - get this - lead to sex.

Even leuk zijn de reacties:

> Joana: you've pretty much summarised my literary tastes. what are you doing this weekend??? ;)

> I once had a double win on the tube when reading Salman Rushdie's Midnight Children and a woman asked me my opinion of it as she had been thinking of reading it for a while. Before I could reply however, the woman next to me stated it was her favourite book by him and she'd read all his works. We all immediately got off at the next stop and went to the nearest hotel room for hours of debauched sex. Actually, we didn't.
