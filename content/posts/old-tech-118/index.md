I love TextMate!

I am writing a big old LaTeX file and I do not have time to cope with [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/)'s idiosyncracies. I know LaTeX pretty well, and if you do, a Word-like WYSIWIG editor only gets in your way.

Enter TextMate! [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) has very good LaTeX support but the thing I am using most is the built in instabuild shortcut. Pressing Command-B immediately saves my document, builds it with pdflatex and displays both progress and the result in a TextMate output window. If the build fails, it also parses the output and clicking an error jumps you to the corresponding line in the document.

Love it!

[Vim](http://www.vim.org) prolly could do this stuff as well, but I had a hard time getting my Vim to behave the same on OS X as it did on Linux and it still doesn't feel right. This does.
