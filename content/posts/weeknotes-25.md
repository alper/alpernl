Let's see how this goes. Consider this a try out for now.

I tried [750 words](http://www.750words.com/), but I'd like my writing efforts to be viewed by a larger public and be of some use. Weeknotes for me could solve the problem of recapping what it was I actually did in a week (and also show other people what it is I actually do).

### Monday

I wrote [an overview of the first chapter](/dingen/2010/06/check-in-check-out-case-by-case-%E2%80%94-case-0001-%E2%80%9Cpasjes-en-poortjes%E2%80%9D/) of Check in / Check out. That got [picked up by Adam Greenfield](http://twitter.com/agpublic/status/16755329575) the following day by the miracle of trackbacks and Google Translate. Good as well, because I need to do some prepwork on Transmobility before meeting with people from 9292ov next week.

Check in / Check out has a series of design principles at the end of each chapter. Those might be interesting to a wider audience, so I'm going to translate those to English.

I finished a presentation on two transportation concepts for Amsterdam, both involving water. Still waiting to hear back from my city council member, but that may be publishable in the near future.

I went to a meeting on [the future of the Amstel station](http://www.wibautaandeamstel.nl/projecten/amstelstation) next to my house. Here's a picture of their bold plans where I most probably won't be living anymore by the time they are completed:

### Tuesday

Tuesday was the real start of project Ebi more on which [at Leapfroglog](http://leapfrog.nl/blog/archives/2010/06/25/week-155-156/).

We managed to cover quite some ground, but because of the plurality of our options, the creative process can be quite devastating draining.

I unfortunately missed the Amsterdam.js meetup, but I'm happy that the AMS programming scene is reactivating.

### Wednesday

The good start of Ebi (and its subsequent celebrations took their toll). After a slow start at Stumptown —where I may be found regularly on weekday mornings— I got to the office where I was stuck till 22:00 because of the slowness of the iOS4 update.

Did some work on _puebla_ which is a low data but heavy content dataviz to be published in the near future.

Also published [the UX Triangle](/dingen/2010/06/ux-triangle/) a funnily accurate model of the UX community.

### Thursday

The rest of the week wasn't that productive due to a touch of flu. Did some more work on Ebi.

### Friday

More work on Ebi (designs of which by the way are coming along and are ridiculously awesome).

In the afternoon I had a studio day with [Dirk van Oosterbosch](http://www.mediamatic.net/person/3347/en) at his Damrak studio. We discussed progress on the Table Viewer and another more commercial but innovative HTML5 project.

Then it was off to the [Cineville](http://www.cineville.nl/) launch party. Cineville is an all-you-can-eat movie pass for 13 Amsterdam art house cinemas. They recently redeveloped their site to become a hub for the pass, the cinemas and everything to do with indie movies in Amsterdam (eventually to become a sort of Last.fm for the cinematic experience). I beta tested the release (rather enthusiastically) and was curious to their future plans.

### Saturday

Nothing much except a good coffee (at Stumptown again!) and professional discussion with [Taco](http://twitter.com/tacoe).

### Sunday

More work on Ebi. The site is mostly functional now in Django but I've also read up on both [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) and [REDIS](http://code.google.com/p/redis/) because of the inherent flexibility requirements of a project such as this one.

Somewhere this week I also started to read [Designing for the Digital Age](http://www.cooper.com/journal/2009/01/designing_for_the_digital_age.html) which is the next book for our [UX Book Club](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=1795982) —now with [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/uxbcams)— and is promising to be quite the read.

That was about it. Now I'm off for a more than overdue BBQ on the beach.
