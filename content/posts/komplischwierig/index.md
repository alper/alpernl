I thought I had come up with the clever portmanteau “komplischwierig”, a combination of “kompliziert”(complicated) and “schwierig”(difficult). Unfortunately a quick Google search showed eight prior results where people have used the word.

The other German neologism I thought I could claim was “Fleischglück”but of course I'm not the first person to come up with that either.
