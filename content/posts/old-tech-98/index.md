The [Laszlo Application Platform](http://www.openlaszlo.org/) was already quite impressive with its XML descriptors rendering into full fledged Flash applications. Now [on Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com/archives/laszlo-demonstrates-ajax-runtime) you can see that they can also render into Ajax so no more Flash.

Is this the start of Ajax == Flash equivalence?

And Flash suddenly got a whole lot [more indispensible](http://ajaxian.com/archives/adobe-announces-a-flex-ajax-bridge).
