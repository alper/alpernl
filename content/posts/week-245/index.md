On Monday we ran through the day's schedule for Code Camping Amsterdam and I did a bunch of work on _guadalupe_.

That night [DUS](http://www.dusarchitects.com/) had an evening about re-imagining architecture at the Coop.

Tuesday I worked at the [Brainsley](http://brainsley.com/) offices and went to the Bits of Freedom drinks in the evening.

The Next Speaker now also carries [my English profile](http://thenextspeaker.com/experts/alper-cugun/) if you need a speaker on the overlap between technology, design and society.

I submitted a proposal about data commons to the conference on the [Social Cities of Tomorrow](http://www.socialcitiesoftomorrow.nl/) by [the Mobile City](http://www.themobilecity.nl/).

Friday was for the final preparations for Code Camping Amsterdam ( [write-up here](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/2011/11/code-camping-klaar/)), our largest [Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl) event to date. We had the entire day hacking at the derelict Shell Tower —I [wrote about it before](/dingen/2011/11/code-camping-amsterdam-imminent/)— across the water in Amsterdam with great food and coffee and a party at night for another several hundred people.
