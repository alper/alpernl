Today I got the idea and I think I've seen spectrum plots like these before but I couldn't quite figure out where. So I dumped all my blogposts and got into [Processing](http://processing.org/) to plot it out. It should look something like this but less ugly:

[![Temporal Distribution of my Blogposts](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3452/3197163008_7792d27d46.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/3197163008/ "Temporal Distribution of my Blogposts by illustir, on Flickr")

It clearly shows when I started blogging on this Wordpress in April of 2007 and then how my blogging has become more and more sparse with initially some dense areas and later on some blank ones.

I'll probably do some iterations on this concept, one with some interaction and another one with [blocks aggregated by day of the week](http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/images/LAoz.gif).
