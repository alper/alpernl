I've been meaning to finish reading up on German history. If I read the five books below, I should be in a great place.

- Heart of Europe: A History of the Holy Roman Empire
- Iron Kingdom, the Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600-1947
- History of Germany 1780-1918: The Long Nineteenth Century
- Weimar Germany: Promise and Tragedy
- Hitler: Ascent 1889-1939
