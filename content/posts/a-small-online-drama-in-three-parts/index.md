Suppose you're a well-known journalists hosting a weekly rather left podcast around topics such as migration, the climate and criticism of right-wing frames in the media. And then suppose you let yourself get baited majorly by an American alt-right activist.

This particular video was going around on German twitter and all the usual suspects were letting themselves get baited by it including above mentioned Friedemann. I [wrote about their podcast previously](/dingen/?s=piratensender) and I couldn't resist so I confronted him on it.

So I got blocked.

I mean "obsessive", sure. Being a major league hypocrite is one of the best ways to bait me.

I did listen to this podcast very regularly but after October 7th it's become so absurdly pro-Israel that it invalidates their entire previous position. The only situation where I've seen people parrot a line so hardcore like that was Dutch men with Russian wives after Putin had just invaded the Crimean Peninsula (“You have to understand Putin has a point.”).
