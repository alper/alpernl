I think this is a leveling definition that I can live with: "Managers are paid to drive results with some support. Directors are paid to drive results with little or no supervision ('set and forget'). VPs are paid to make the plan."

Or if I would paraphrase this: Directors are barrels (not bullets). VPs need to create the circumstances where you are 'certain to win'.
