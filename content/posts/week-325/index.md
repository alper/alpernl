I'm running frightfully behind with these and debating whether to continue writing weeknotes if it means this work is being featured in a total of three places. That seems a bit too much.

Way back then I pushed [Cuppings](http://www.cuppin.gs/) to the App Store.

I gave an interview about Politwoops:

I built a preliminary Foursquare paper map creating tool.

I was featured in WDR Funkhaus Europa with a small item about Politwoops:

And also a tweet I posted was [featured on the New York Times](http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/civil-disobedience-on-a-turkish-game-show/?smid=tw-thelede&seid=auto) website:

And finally I dropped by the office warming of [IXDS](http://ixds.de/) who have a brilliant space two streets down from us on the waterside.

And finally that Saturday I had a beer with @pinboard at the Berlin [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) meetup.
