For project Statlas, we kicked off the design framework with Alexander and made some good strides with that. Also met with Kilian for progress on the renderer.
I acquired a small Python script from [Henkjan](http://twitter.com/hjfaber) that we were allowed to release as open source, a [Rijksdriehoekscoordinatien to WGS84 converter](https://github.com/MonsterSwell/rd2wgs84). I had been meaning to write this myself, but felt we shouldn't duplicate the effort.

I did [a call](http://twitter.com/#!/monsterswell/status/24479808805146624) on Monster Swell to collaborate more with designers at any and all levels and got some response to that. More are welcome.

For project Maguro I started prototyping the game's data model and the message queue using [Celery](http://celeryproject.org/). Thursday I went on to make a playable barebones version of the game in django. The team was pretty psyched about that turned out.

Administration wise started the new year with a new sheet of books.

Socially, I went to the Django meetup. The [Djangocon in Amsterdam](http://www.djangocon.eu/) is going to be awesome. Also the [ISOC](http://www.isoc.nl/) had their New Year's Drink on Thursday.

Lastly on Friday I had a meeting with the city of Amsterdam and the [Waag](http://waag.org) for [Hack de Overheid](http://hackdeoverheid.nl) to talk about the series of open data events this spring and an app contest for the city.
