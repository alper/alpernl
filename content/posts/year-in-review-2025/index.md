## Sports and Health

One year where I did not seriously injure myself and could continue to practice sports.

I started going to the gym regularly in the evenings after the kids are sleeping. After some initial cold water fear I started barbell exercises. The goal is to squat and deadlift at least my bodyweight of 75kg. I'm inching this up very slowly and am currently at 40kg.

Going to the gym is supported by my Fitbod subscription. Exercising for me is only possible if I don't have to think or plan what I'm going to do. That means either a human or an app that tells me what I have to do. Given that the gym is paid for by my work, I can justify the steep monthly cost of Fitbod (here's [a 14-day guest pass](https://go.fitbod.link/XprO/8ovqn6mu)).

I'm doing winter cycling on the trainers at the gym while I debate whether I should get one for at home. That makes me one of those crazy people who wears a *chamois* to the gym.

It was a great year for cycling. I bought a proper road bike and I managed to join group rides (mostly those of the MAAP LAB Berlin) more or less weekly without having a single mechanical or crash. *knocks on wood*

But then during a solo ride in the last week of the year I managed to slip and fall over. More than the minor damage to my knee and my carbon frame, it was my ego that was bruised.

## Studies

I read a bunch of papers around LLMs and found the field to be relatively tame. I don't think that single percentage point increases in performance and translations of BFS algorithms into LLM prompts are worth writing up.

Learning Japanese continues and I'm now at [Wanikani level 22](https://www.wanikani.com/level/22). I'm not sure what my next goal is and after my trip to Japan my motivation is on the rocks.

The only problem is that once you start studying Japanese, you're not supposed to stop. While I work through this I'm at maintenance which is around 200 reviews per day.

## Books

I already posted about how bad of a year 2025 was for reading. Not sure whether I'll find the time to do better next year.

## Movies and TV

I've moved the tracking of everything that I watch over to Trakt saying goodbye to Letterboxd.

Here too I need an app which tracks which episodes I've already watched and what's next up because I'll very easily lose track of this myself. Trakt is excellent at this and offers it in the free version. I pay for premium to get some of the more advanced list management versions.

The movies I watched in 2025:

* Wicked
* Moana 2
* Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion
* Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
* Lilo & Stitch
* KPop Demon Hunters
* Encanto
* The Greatest Showman

Trakt tells me that's 901 minutes spent on movies.

Wicked was lovely on the big screen. Of the kids movies I watched: KPop Demon Hunters is impeccable, Moana 2 was unnecessary, Encanto was strangely forgettable, Lilo & Stitch not as bad as I would expect. The Greatest Showman may be flawed but it is full of bangers.

The tv series I watched in 2025:

* Bluey S3
* The Wheel of Time S2
* The Bear S1+S2+S3+S4
* Neon Genesis Evangelion
* Dennou Coil
* Asura
* Cyberpunk Edge Runners
* Legend of the Galactic Heroes S1
* Heated Rivalry
* Kaiju No.8

Trakt tells me that this is 4567 minutes spent on episodes.

## Games

I don't really track this anymore, but what I can note are the following.

**Expedition 33** was a gaming highlight. I saw it on Tiktok and immediately knew I had to experience it. Not having a console I played it via [cloud gaming](https://boosteroid.com) on my Macbook.

Playing a parry/dodge game over a cloud gaming setup is a particular kind of masochism, but with difficulty set to easy, it was kind of doable. The gameplay loop is satisfying but after a while it does get somewhat tedious. What deserves praise are the music, the writing and the major set pieces in the boss battles and in the environment.

**Critical Role** started their campaign 4 and having followed the online RPG scene through Tiktok clips for a while now, I decided to see what the fuss was about. The [first episode](https://trakt.tv/shows/critical-role/seasons/4/episodes/1) together with the rest of the ouverture is spectacular. It's a victory of setup, emotions, reveals and backstabbing. I'm not sure if they'll stick the landing, but for now I'm in for the ride.

I'll have to delve into what makes this worthwhile. For now I can say it's a mix of two things. There is an element of let's play parasociality that you have with any game stream or impro podcast. Add to that a very meticulously brewed high fantasy setting that does not have to compromise on runtime or production values and will not be cancelled after one or two seasons.

**Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown** was discounted and became the game we played during the Christmas break. I led on exploring the city on Mount Qaf with my kids on a lower difficulty setting right on my heels.

It's a great game where the platform mechanics continue to layer on top of each other together with some very nasty puzzles bordering on the outright sadistic. Persian culture also provides a vast and mostly unknown to us landscape of culture, artifacts and mythology to serve as backdrop for this game. A lot of it is undoubtedly historically not accurate, but that does not make it any less nice to look at.

## Podcasts

The two podcasts I listen to most consistently are Ones and Tooze and Past Present Future. Those are both remnants of my Talking Politics period. Maybe I should add Helen Thompson's podcast as well and have a full lid?

Other than that I occasionally listen to The Adam Friedland show, Stavy's World, KALT'ın Podacst'i, Cortex, Developer Voices, Vergecast, Feminist Shelf Control, The Catskills Podcast, De Shitshow, Oxide and Friends, Escape Collective (only during the Tour), Podcast Filosofie

I more or less stopped listening to Trashfuture finding the jokes and the commentary repetitive and boring.
