Nothing much happened during the Christmas week before, so I decided to skip that note. Most of Berlin shut down into a deep hibernation normally only witnessed in student towns.

Everything only got into gear again on by Thursday when I got my copy of [Gun Machine](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14739231-gun-machine) (and finished it two days after) and caught up studio flows with Hubbub Utrecht. I did my work on _TORREON_ and had lunch with the vvvv guys.

Friday it was more _TORREON_ going on through the weekend and some consulting on _KAIGARA_.

I also caught up with some talks at the CCC this year (along with all of the other issues the event had this year). Best of show is this one by Eleanor Saitta and Smári McCarthy about the advantages and disadvantages of networks and institutions:

A short week that one too, but more to come.
