Listening to the Trash Future team describe CulturePulse.ai and the digital twin profile created for entire populations seems very very reminiscent of [“The Red Men”](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/2263657) by Matthew de Abaitua which didn't get the attention it deserved but was quite prescient.

Elements from the book such as the corporation known as “Monad”(!) and robotic public service utilities called “Dr. Easy”are looking back from our current hellscape period a bit too on the nose.

See Dr. Easy act in this short film: https://vimeo.com/68368877
