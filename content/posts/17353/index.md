This article is a wild premise, a wild ride and a wild conclusion (also I'm increasingly warming to the idea of htmx).

> "Every cloud-pilled, react-vue-braindead, click-to-deploy developer actually thinks web views require 7 minutes to “compile for production,”then when live require 5-15 second “skeleton loaders”on entry is just a fact of life nobody can question or ever improve on modern 5 GHz machines with 5 Gbps network connections. Developers, at the median, have been getting less capable and more focused on made up silo/cult/trendy dead-end fads for 10 years and the entire world suffers daily."
