This was the week of getting a lot of things done and a minor John Boyd obsession. I read [the biography by Coram](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38840.Boyd) and queued the PhD thesis by Osinga to read as soon as I finish Latour's Aramis ((This is all a move towards reading more foundational works (I [wrote about that here](/dingen/2013/08/apply-your-philosophy/)) instead of the pop-sci that permeates everything.)). [Frans Osinga](http://www.defensie.nl/nlda/onderzoek_en_onderwijs/wetenschappelijk_medewerkers/krijgswetenschappen/extra_informatie_osinga) is a rather impressive fellow if you look at his Ministry of Defense webpage. We were joking around that having a design event with him would be brilliant mind-expand. Unfortunately events take too much time to organize so that won't be happening anytime soon.

One thing to keep in mind from Boyd's tragic life is to make the decision to either [Be Somebody or to Do Something](http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=78cbbb7f2882629a5157fa593&id=ec0af280d3). Most people I hang out with all want to Do Something, but it does pay to keep in mind how it will work out for you personally.

I made a brief stop in Aachen ((Small towns across Europe are scary places filled with old people and conservatism.)) before heading to the Netherlands to catch up with local coffee, for some quality time at Hubbub HQ and meeting Amsterdam friends.

To prepare for that visit to the Netherlands I had to kill another two hours at the local Bürgeramt because the Meldebescheinigung I had was not recent enough for some stupid Dutch institution.
