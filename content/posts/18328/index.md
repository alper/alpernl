The write-up how Bun can be so fast is a good exploration in all the things that computers are good at now. Machines and our networks have gotten much faster and much more parallel which influences what an optimal approach to building software is now.

We don't use Bun but I'm happy to see that even on these benchmarks `pnpm` is no slouch. You could do much worse than that.
