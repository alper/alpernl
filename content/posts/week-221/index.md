Belayed notes for the week before last but right now I'm bored out of my skull so it's as good a time as any other.

[Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl) made an overwhelming presence at the Spring Break of the [Stimuleringsfonds voor de Pers](http://www.stimuleringsfondspers.nl/) to promote the cause of data-journalism in the Netherlands.

Real estate-wise we arranged to add two adjacent rooms in the [Volkskrantgebouw](http://www.volkskrantgebouw.nl). One of the rooms will be occupied by the lovely chaps of [Bottlenose](http://bottlenose.com/) and the other one will be used as a meeting/project room.

Adding additional region sets to [Statlas](http://statlas.nl) was succesful with some extra work. Projection conversion for Shapefiles is a rather difficult affair even with the [EPSG Registry](http://www.epsg-registry.org/) and the [Spatial Reference](http://spatialreference.org/).

Also visited the [Djangocon EU](http://www.djangocon.eu/), home of the faithful Django programmes. Django is still a venerable workhorse for many many of our projects.

Attended a lecture by Alain de Botton and [his new book](http://business.in.com/article/ideas-to-change-the-world/alain-de-botton-a-religion-for-atheists/13532/1) has a stance of using the cognitive psychology inherent in religion to improve secular life. Something which also the most ambitious design pieces do.

Friday was an interesting day and it was closed off by us having drinks at [Ouroffice](http://twitter.com/ouroffice):
