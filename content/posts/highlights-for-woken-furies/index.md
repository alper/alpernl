> That, of course, doesn't apply to Envoys. We just used to go silently, crush the odd planetary uprising, topple the odd regime, and then plug in something UN-compliant that worked. Slaughter and suppression across the stars, for the greater good — naturally — of a unified Protectorate.

> The Envoys came and they tore your world apart. It wasn't that simple, of course; the truth was far more complex, and ultimately far more scary. But who in this universe wants the truth?

> 'Well, Quell looked back at this black-clad man and as she stared into his hot jet eyes she knew that he spoke the truth, that he was a man of his word. So she looked at the revolver in her hand and then back at the man. And she said then you are a fanatic and cannot learn, and she shot him in the face.'

> The Quellists meanwhile simply slipped away, disappeared, abandoned the struggle and got on with living their lives as Nadia Makita had always argued they should be prepared to do. Technology has given us access to timescales of life our ancestors could only dream of, we must be prepared to use that timescale, to live on that timescale, if we are to realise our own dreams.

> Just reminding you, is all. This life is like the sea. There's a three-moon tidal slop running out there and if you let it, it'll tear you apart from everyone and everything you ever cared about.'

> 'So maybe some other time,' he said quietly. 'When you're not carrying so much.'
>
> 'Yeah. Maybe.' It wasn't any other time I could usefully imagine, unless he was talking about the past, and I couldn't see any way to get back there.

> The Harlanites recognise it as well as we do, and they have already made their move. It only remains for us to make ours. If in the end I have to fight and die for the ghost and memory of Quellcrist Falconer and not the woman herself, then that will be better than not fighting at all.'

> But in one of her less passionate moments, Quell herself once offered an escape clause for situations such as these. If the facts are against you, she said, but you cannot bear to cease believing — then at least suspend judgment. Wait and see.'

> It was a confirmation that the time had come, that the political pot was boiling over. Of course it was going to spill, of course it was all going to fall in the same direction, onto the floor. Where else could it go?

> Who ever gets a second shot at these things? Sooner or later, we all get in up to our necks. Then it s just a question of keeping your face out of the swamp, one stumbling step at a time.

> 'I think she might be some kind of weapon, Sylvie.'
>
> 'So? Aren't we all?'

> I'd felt twinges of the same thing after, the fresh growth of comradeship and united purpose — and I'd ripped it up by the roots every time. That shit will get you killed. Get you used.

> Everyone scrabbling for cash. Oligarchical caretakers. Piss-easy control system.
