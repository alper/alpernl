I booked my [trip and accommodation in Paris](http://www.dopplr.com/trip/alper/3428356). I'm quite looking forward to see that city again.

On Tuesday we had a big office lunch along with the people from [Schnelle Bunte Bilder](http://schnellebuntebilder.de/?lang=en).

Wednesday we had our weekly German language class.

And that night I worked late to finish TORREON. A small project that took up way too much time as all small projects do.

That same night I helped a kid in the Netherlands do his maths homework. I think it is standard practice for kids in the Netherlands to share pictures of their homework issues on social media. This time I got caught by one and managed to help the kid out decomposing square roots.

Niels managed to hit another high with his contribution to [Recess!](http://nielsthooft.com/recess-5-in-a-world). I think it may be about time to create a single serving website for tat serial.

Reading is something I still manage to do quite a lot though I have given up reading articles in Instapaper and have been reading a solid streak of books again. Some [friends didn't agree](http://branch.com/b/ok-we-need-to-talk-about-read-it-later-bankruptcy-and-beer#34orYtClr4E) and they think the solution to this problem lies in craft beer.

On Friday morning we had a meeting with the breakfast gang. My [blurb for TNW magazine](http://thenextweb.com/magazine/2013/02/19/issue-v1-2-lets-ask-the-experts/) was published on the open web.

And we closed off the week with a nice game of Citadels.
