Recently news came out on [Jetty continuations](http://www.mortbay.com/MB/log/gregw/?permalink=Jetty6Continuations.html&page=comments) and they are indeed looking pretty good.

I cannot really tell how Jetty compares to [Tomcat](http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/). I only work with Jetty as an end user and my experiences with Tomcat have been limited to drowning in the XML configuration quagmire.
