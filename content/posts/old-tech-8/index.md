I am in the process of convincing myself I can justify the purchase of an iBook. I was in a [Mac store in Amsterdam](http://www.denieuwemacwinkel.nl) this afternoon to get a feel for the 12" models and was pretty close to buying it on the spot.

Now I get a link to a [special offer](http://tudelft.mac.nl) for students at DUT at Apple Centre MacHouse which gives me 15% off of the normal price. At these rates I'm definitely going for it and might even consider buying a Powerbook.

One of the arguments I'm using to convince myself I'll need it is that buying a Mac will be a life changing experience. It will, won't it?
