Today I finally finished my notes on the paper [“Group, Community or Social Network”](http://www.alper.nl/wiki/index.php/Group%2C_Community%2C_or_Social_Network:_A_Discussion) by [Lois Ann Scheidt](http://www.loisscheidt.com/).

The paper studies 6 forms of CMC and examines how they measure up in the form of Group, Community and Social Network and it also provides definitions of those three terms.

The conclusion is that the concept of community is *nebulous*.
