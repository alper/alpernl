A busy and monotonous week with deadlines for many long running projects.

1\. Monday saw my last official lecture at [WdKA](http://www.wdka.nl/#85IrLd546tAr5d0G30he1P0l-0). Students will present their work next week which I'm looking forward to greatly.

2\. Worked the entire week for _maguro_ which is going into a pilot run as I am typing this.

3\. _Acapulco_ saw an initial release but needs a bit more touching up.

4\. [Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/): [Apps for Amsterdam](http://appsforamsterdam.nl/) edition was this Saturday. I was the host of this event we had been preparing for a long time was every bit the succes we had hoped it would be. We had lots of friends come over and useful applications were created.

I visited the [Virtueel Platform](http://virtueelplatform.nl/) book presentation and the [Big Brother Awards](https://www.bigbrotherawards.nl/) on Wednesday. Both e-culture and privacy in the narrow sense remain difficult but relevant concepts for me.
