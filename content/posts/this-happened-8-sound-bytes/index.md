> There were all these connotations of playfulness from your childhood.

> We modeled it using lego. It has nice affordances.

> Here's a man staring at something he built with his own hands.

> It's as if his face is about to break from smiling so hard.

> We didn't imagine that two people wanted to sit on the thing at the same time. Which was quite erotic actually.

> Two girls one chick.
