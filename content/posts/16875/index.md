People want local development but I feel a lot of the reasons and movements described here are valid.

[https://dx.tips/the-end-of-localhost](https://dx.tips/the-end-of-localhost)

When I try to unpack it, it's usually not even very clear what 'local development' means but I think it's something along the lines of: 1. Being able to manipulate the system under development immediately using the command-line. 2. Not being able to break an unrelated system and not having somebody else break your development environment. I get that those two things are essential but there's nothing in them that requires them to take place on your physical laptop.
