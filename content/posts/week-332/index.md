Oh, this week. This week was how to put it rather intense.

We got visits again from [Peter Rukavina](https://twitter.com/ruk) and this time [Thomas](https://twitter.com/mygdal) dropped in as well to make it a proper Reboot reunion. I decided to join Peter (Bihr) to go to London in October to attend Playful and Mozilla Festival and potentially [Gamecity](http://gamecity.co.uk/) too which is supposed to be an awesome conference in Nottingham. I've never been outside of London so that alone may be worth the trip.

I also had a visit of my old friend [Bjorn](https://twitter.com/bjornvanraaij) who I worked with at a company that shall not be named but that was deep in the territory of the bizarre.

I spent the beginning of that week prepping for a client engagement which got me waking up on Wednesday somewhere before five o'clock to take a hellish cab ride into Tegel airport. You are never driven to Tegel in the same way twice, but I'll definitely make sure never to take the highway again.

During the flight I also managed to spill coffee both over my clothes and my laptop and that was all before I even arrived in Munich. That was a rather terrible start of a day that turned out very well. That evening we celebrated our success with a Tsukemen ramen at a local Munich ramen joint ((Who knew that Munich even had ramen places let alone a ramen place that serves an interpretation of tsukemen!?)).

The next day we did another day at the client after which having been nicely friend I took an S-Bahn to the airport. Munich airport right now has the best feature ever. There is a beer garden in between the two terminals where you can cheaply load up on a local microbrew before you board your plane. Every airport should have this.

Then after having done all of this and with hardly enough sleep I dropped into our weekly Sheperditchi breakfast and then straight into a OpenGL ES course given by Stijn Oomes. Stijn has a PhD from my alma mater and we know many of the sam people even though I didn't have too many interactions with the computer graphics group at my faculty. We had talked earlier that year about his [current pursuit of 3D vision](http://www.solid-perspective-vision.com/) and about the potential of such a workshop for iOS programmers. It was a thoroughly enjoyable day of pure learning with a lot of hands on and a knowledgeable teacher at hand.

That evening I joined the [Berlin Critical Mass](http://cmberlin.blogsport.de/) which is changing for the better and after that I watched Only God Forgives. A brilliant contemplative orgy of violence, shades of which I am seeing in Hotline Miami which I'm playing right now.

And the next day I got my first sailing lessons —which I had half forgotten I was supposed to have— and after that I finally had some time to catch up on e-mail. Pretty odd how something that was such a critical part of infrastructure in this part of the world is nothing more than a pass time for well off people at the moment.
