At our nice coworking spot [Studio 4 Stagioni](http://studio4stagioni.nl/) we have one or two desks available effective immediately. This poster has been hanging on some select locations around town:

The ad is in Dutch, but it says you can get a desk in a creative environment next to the Delft central train station for €85 a month (cost). If you're interested or know somebody who is, get in touch either here or using the phone number on the ad.
