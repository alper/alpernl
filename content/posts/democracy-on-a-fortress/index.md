The weekend before last we were on a fortress (part of [the defense works of Amsterdam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stelling_van_Amsterdam)) to spend a day on hacking civic data for [Apps for Noord-Holland](http://appsfornoordholland.nl/).

During that day I was interviewed by [Netwerk Democratie](http://netdem.nl/) about open data and digital democracy. The resulting video is here below:
