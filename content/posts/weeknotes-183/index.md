We moved in our new desks and got rid of the old ones. This clears up a lot of space in [the studio](http://twitter.com/ouroffice) and we now have a fifth desk [open for lease](http://twitter.com/ouroffice/status/24394400840). If you're design minded and interested in a great place in a creative hub of Amsterdam, [get in touch](http://aardverschuiving.com/contact).

Monday I visited the finissage of fashion and architecture at [ARCAM](http://www.arcam.nl) and went to the [Typekit](http://www.typekit.com) meetup organized by [Adaptive Path](http://www.adaptivepath.com).

Tuesday we resumed development on [PLAY Pilots](http://playpilots.nl) to integrate the website with the [Stereoscoop](http://playpilots.nl/games/de-stereoscoop/) game being built by [Zesbaans](http://zesbaans.nl). I spent a good part of Friday at their studio working on further integration and communication between our systems.

I'm planning an informal data drinks this Friday after [PICNIC](http://picnicnetwork.org) called [the Dutch Data Drinks](http://www.facebook.com/#!/event.php?eid=160152187333385). A ton of people I know are busy working with data in some fashion or another. It is about time these people got to know each other and work together.

Wednesday there was a small victory. I'm busy as a local operative for the [Urbanode project](http://www.vurb.eu/2010/04/09/the-urbanode-project/) and working on the intermediary layer between the application server and the club lights. After fiddling a bit in the [Melkweg](http://www.melkweg.nl/), we got some lights to be controlled by a Python script, which was very nice.

Thursday I visited the Boffel by our Dutch digital civil liberties organization [Bits of Freedom](http://www.bof.nl/) who were celebrating their first year anniversary. I cosigned [a letter by them](/dingen/2010/09/brief-tegen-censuur/) against web censorship. After that I also visited a Speed Show of net art curated guerilla style in a local internet café.

Saturday went to see the Next Big Thing exhibition by the Sandberg Institute which was pretty much the archetype of a mixed bag.

Also busy writing a piece for [NRC](http://www.nrc.nl), which is progressing slowly.
