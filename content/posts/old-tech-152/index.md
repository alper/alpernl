I have been invitated to present at [TOPdesk](http://www.topdesk.com) to our consultants the relative merits of using a wiki to organize our knowledge as opposed to the facilities we used to have.

I am one of the main instigators of the TOPwiki (as it is being called) and I am big on social software, so I was the obvious choice to defend it. And I will have to defend it because my prospective audience is more than a bit critical of the wiki. They want clear rationale on why we are changing from our existing knowledge management infrastructure to this one.

Fair enough. The short answer is that the existing infrastructure is a joke but it is deeply entrenched in our organizational practice. This makes for some pretty hefty switching costs both conceptually and practically.

I can deflect all of their arguments easily but I want to solidify my footing theoretically both to give them some knowledge management concepts and social software ideas to take home and to prevent it from becoming a free for all shooting match.
