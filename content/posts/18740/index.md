Congratulations Django! One of the programming frameworks that has had the most impact on my professional life and has always been nothing other than good to me.

My early software engineering career was building web apps during a time where most people believed this was difficult and Django made writing them exceptionally easy. That was a very nice trick to be able to exploit for the better part of 10 years.

Twenty years later and backend development is not in a dramatically better place in most places. Many of the problems are fundamental, the requirements are non-functional and fundamental improvements are few and far between.

In this environment, Django is still very much relevant.
