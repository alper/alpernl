[Reboot 10](http://reboot.dk) is over and in my experience they simply get better every year.

I'd signed up for a session and got slotted on Thursday morning so I spent a good part of Wednesday preparing and running through the story. Of course after having gotten over [my early flight](/dingen/2008/06/off-to-copenhagen/) and having eaten something at the [Laundromat](http://www.thelaundromatcafe.com/).

My session on [Free Economics](http://www.reboot.dk/artefact-5148-en.html) was filled over capacity while it was meant to be a cosy conversational session. Fortunately that also meant more than enough people willing to participate and add information, so I think it went well and it proved a good starting point for the rest of the conference. My stress relieved could follow the rest of the sessions.

There were a number of other Dutch presenters most notably: Kars, Ton, [Ianus](http://www.reboot.dk/artefact-4743-en.html) and [Iskander](http://www.reboot.dk/artefact-4750-en.html). Unfortunately I didn't see any of them present, but I'll catch up on that when the video's are posted. Being programmed against [Andy Budd](http://www.reboot.dk/artefact-4325-en.html) meant that I missed his presentation as well, but maybe I wouldn't have fitted in the completely full small room anyway.

It was a joy to hear music in the presentation on [Tradition by Jeremy Keith](http://www.reboot.dk/artefact-4676-en.html). More music is usually a good idea as we would also see in the final party.

On Reboot I never can keep up going to sessions and usually it's better not to. The interactions in the hallways and the lobby especially during the lull when there are sessions going on are more interesting on a personal level than anything else.

The first day's talk got concluded by a fun [treatment of information](http://www.reboot.dk/artefact-5540-en.html) by David Weinberger. During dinner it was also very interesting to get a preview of his session from [Siert Wijnia about his Fablab](http://www.reboot.dk/artefact-5612-en.html) and what the commoditization of the production process will do to product design and manufacturing.
