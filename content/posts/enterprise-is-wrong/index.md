[Tim Bray speaks out on](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/02/Doing-It-Wrong) what those of us without a vested interest in the disfunctional business practices of enterprise software already knew and have been saying for years:

> The community of developers whose work you see on the Web \[…\] deploy _better systems_ at _less cost_ in _less time_ at _lower risk_ than we see in the Enterprise.

It's a sham and it's crumbling but slowly enough that if you're mediocre developer you will not want for work for the foreseeable future (but you will not be doing interesting things either).
