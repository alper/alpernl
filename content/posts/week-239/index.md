Running dreadfully behind with these weeknotes so this would have to be a short one.

I lost my fixie which was something of a blow. Feeling a bit hurt and crippled from this loss. Going to look for a new ride come spring.

I had lunch with [Alexander Zeh](http://www.alexanderzeh.me/) and [Peter Robinett](http://www.bubblefoundry.com/) of [Mio Giro](http://www.miogiro.com/).

There is some space shortage at the Open Cooperatie but spirits at [Hack de Overheid](http://hackdeoverheid.nl) were high:

I participated in a knowledge gathering session organized by [Info.nl](http://info.nl) about the future of the tax system in a fully networked society. There were some very interesting people present but always, talking with people who don't make anything is a waste of time.

Also conceived of a special event for the playful people of the Netherlands. Stay tuned for updates on that.

Sargasso is very kind to us and [says that Hack de Overheid](http://sargasso.nl/archief/2011/10/11/oproep-verbeelding-2-0-aan-de-macht/#comment-673838) approach is the new way of changing the world. We are very humbled (but would tend to agree).

I was a bit annoyed by voices against the ‘Creative Class’ and wrote a retort: [“Stop Kicking the Creative Class”](/dingen/2011/10/stop-kicking-the-creative-class/)

I put the very modest advice work I did on the new [Vrij Nederland](http://vn.nl) site [on my portfolio](http://aardverschuiving.com/portfolio#vrijnederland). I am glad I got the right people together, could help out some friends and that the result is so excellent.

I wrote a review of [the Binding of Isaac](http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/) for [nrc.next](http://nrcnext.nl/) due to be published soon. It is a deceptively deep and addictive game.

I had coffee with our good friend [Toine Donk](http://toinedonk.nl/) who is doing very interesting things with books. And I worked the rest of the afternoon at the offices of [Brainsley](http://brainsley.com/). Besides good friends, they are my hope for innovation in Dutch publishing.

[Ianus Keller](http://www.forinspirationonly.com/) and other friends were at [Design by Fire](http://www.designbyfire.nl/2011/) (which seems to have been very good) and they give me hope with the following tweet:

Brainsley had their office warming party on Saturday which was a fantastic convention of internet, fashion and assorted other people:
