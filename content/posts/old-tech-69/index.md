Recently there has been a barrage of negative news about Wikipedia with class action law suits, various individuals editing their own biographies, false fact injections offset by the news fact that Wikipedia is pretty good compared to Encyclopedia Britannica (and that Dutch Wikipedia compares similarly to the Winkler Prince).

The negative news spurs are cheap potshots towards a project which is run on the good will of volunteers in a fashion which is as near to open source management as you can get.

In open source, if you see something is wrong you fix it. You cannot force someone else to fix it because nobody is getting paid to do the work and everybody has lives of their own.

Complaining vocally is usually not the best way of getting the improvement you want. In the same time and effort you could have [fixed it yourself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributing_to_Wikipedia).
