[Project Ebi](http://blog.playpilots.nl/) is taking most of my capacity and brain these days, so everything else is necessarily pushed to the back burner a bit.

In other news…

I started drafting [an open letter in Dutch](http://piratepad.net/2QwPw0cg0S) regarding the information platform for transit data for the Netherlands which will be created in the near future. We ( [Open Data Nederland](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=3112848)) want this platform to be open and inclusive to enable the greatest potential for innovation.

Talked about an interesting quantified self dataviz project (codename: _nezahualcoyotl_) with a well-known hardware maker. More dataviz is forthcoming:
_puebla_ got its public deadline (which is quite shortly) but could use some visual design attention
_guadelajara_ got its datasets after some gentle nudging of authorities, expect some first draft renders for that soon

I also did [a bunch of beta testing](http://www.getsatisfaction.com/peerz) of [Peerz](http://www.peerz.nl/). A Dutch startup I did the initial IA/IxD for. You can [try it out yourself](http://blog.peerz.nl/peerzpads) and could even win an iPad for your efforts.
