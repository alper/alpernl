I'm putting this here so I don't have to keep looking it up.

The name of the game by John Boyd is moral leverage for grand strategy:

> Preserve or build up our moral authority while compromising that of our adversaries in order to pump up our resolve, drain away adversaries' resolve, and attract them as well as others to our cause and way of life.
