I was expecting one package but I got two. So I thought the Threadless guys had messed up somehow.

This however did not seem to be the case. The other package was sent from the [Eclipse Foundation](http://www.eclipse.org/org/) and contained an Eclipse fleece. Very nice surprise guys. Thanks!

The Threadless package was courtesy of the holiday sale and contained [Missing Piece](http://www.threadless.com/product/207/Missing_Piece), [Dark Side of the Garden](http://www.threadless.com/product/256/Dark_Side_of_the_Garden) and [Fill Me Up](http://www.threadless.com/product/153/Fill_Me_Up).
