I'm playing around with [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/) a bit to try and make a dedicated player for [last.tv](http://lasttv.aardverschuiving.com).

I have seldom seen such a mess on all levels. It is very reminiscent of PHP in the lack of design, documentation and compatibility.

It has a massive GUI which serves more to obfuscate than it helps. It's responsiveness and polish on OS X are a joke.

I'll take JavaScript and browser quirks any day.
