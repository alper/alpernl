It took a bit to get going again back from Greece.

More work on Beestenbende which had a push to finish everything on the deck. I had talks with [Netzpolitik](http://netzpolitik.org/) and [Invisible Playground](http://invisibleplayground.com/).

I briefly visited an event by [Platoon](http://www.platoon.org/) about the interplays between gentrification and graffiti which was about as absurd as it sounds.

I published my [notes on the Greek situation](/dingen/2012/06/greece-a-society-undergoing-stockholm-syndrome/).

I received my copy of [Chouinard's](http://www.patagonia.com/us/patagonia.go?assetid=3351) new book ‘The Responsible Company’:
[![Patagonia outlining (among many other things) how to prevent an anti-gentrification backlash](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7124/7463441660_c39be059f9.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/7463441660/ "Patagonia outlining (among many other things) how to prevent an anti-gentrification backlash by illustir, on Flickr")

Very much looking forward to reading that and applying it here.

Sunday I did a bunch of work on the _kohi_ prototype.
