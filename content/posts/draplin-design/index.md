I got a link to [this video](http://www.jessgibson.com/videos/Draplin_America_is_fucked_newFINAL.mov) from somewhere and it is priceless. It prompted me to do some research and I found [an interview](http://www.hearhear.us/articles/2007/06/24/an-interview-with-draplin-design-co) which confirms that that Aaron Draplin guy is awesome and does really cool work.

(This post mostly for the benefit of my designer friends.)
