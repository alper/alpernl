I had been toying around with various PHP based systems for a while now but now I have finally settled on [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) and I am liking it a lot. I have widely varying needs of scale, management and complexity and Drupal certainly fits the bill for two sites I am currently building.

The product is very mature, the community vibrant and I feel like I have only touched the surface of the flexibility of the node concept.

And thusfar I haven't had to write a line of code. I could Google a —usually— working module or snippet or other workaround for every task I thought of.

The language PHP may be the crap of the crap, but besides Drupal [some](http://www.mediawiki.org) other [applications](http://www.wordpress.org) in it really are the dog's bollocks.
