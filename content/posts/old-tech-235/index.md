I went to [LJS](http://www.ljs.nl) this Saturday to switch my black streak leaving Tucano sleeve for a new one.

I asked about the new [Airport Extreme](http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/) feature where the USB port can be used to mount external hard drives wirelessly. This feature is very killer if you've just built a 320GB external hard drive.

But to ameliorate the mess of cables I have on my desk, I would also like to have [AirTunes](http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/airtunes.html). Unfortunately the Airport Extreme does not sport an audio out and the USB on the Airport Express cannot be used to mount harddrives.

This means I'm torn on Airport.
