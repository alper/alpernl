I was tremendously hyped for [Deutschland '83](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschland_83) after hearing about it and watching the first episode. Now that it is finally airing in Germany it turns out that [it is not doing that well](http://www.tagesspiegel.de/medien/deutschland-83-diese-serie-passt-nicht-ins-deutsche-fernsehen/12701524.html). Viewership started out low and has been declining over the first four episodes.

[![IMG_0181](IMG_0181.jpg)](/dingen/2015/12/deutschland-83/img_0181/)[People are attributing this](https://www.facebook.com/UFAFiction/posts/1095109577195935) to the fact that the average [RTL](http://rtl.de/) viewer is stupid and only used to watch plain episodic series. That may well be true, but the decline of the series's ratings closely mirror the decline of my appetite for the show itself. By episode four Deutschland '83 is a slog and the only thing that got me to the finish line was an empty Sunday and stamina.

The plot devolves and loses whatever internal logic and coherence it had. The characters which are enigmatic to begin with become increasingly hard to empathize with and start doing random things. Worst of all, Deutschland '83 tries to put a neutral spin on one of the most polarized conflicts of the last century which of course fails.

The one message that does come through is that everybody on the East side was evil and psychopathic and that the people on the West side were basically decent chaps. This is a laughable depiction of the world as it was back then (or as [parts of the world still are](http://kottke.org/15/11/conversations-with-and-photos-of-everyday-north-koreans)). The violence and surveillance enacted by the Soviet bloc is hardly different from the stuff the Americans did and still do around the world. The only reason we get to ridicule the East Germans in the series is because they lost.
