I got things back running again. Did a bunch of work on TORREON. Most Hubbub stuff is in [a weeknote over there](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2013/01/week-177/) now that I am writing now alternating with Kars Alfrink.

I updated my Thinkup which proved to be something of a mixed bag now forcing me to upgrade my hosting package.

Wednesday I had my first class of my language course at the Goethe Institute which proved to be a bit too easy for my taste (which is probably always the case if you already know a bunch of languages). The practice will be good for me in any case and I hope to apply the practical parts more and more in German professional life.

Having started everything in Berlin —to my chagrin— on Thursday I went to Amsterdam for the Open State board dinner and some other odds and ends that needed seeing to. That day I also [fasted for my friend Bassel](http://freebassel.org/) who is jailed in Syria just for being a free software activist.

The board dinner that night at the new restaurant my brother runs [Fa. Speijkervet](http://www.speijkervet.nl/) was a lot of fun. There are a lot of changes coming up and almost all of them are for the better.

Friday I hung out at [Koko](https://twitter.com/kokocafe) in Amsterdam. A nice new coffee place run by two girls who are totally into coffee and fashion. A big recommendation if you want to escape the hectic Amsterdam city center. After I did our meeting at [De Gids](http://www.literairtijdschrift-degids.nl/) (again see the Hubbub weeknote), we did a run of the town with Kars and [Alexander Zeh](http://www.topika.cc/).

Saturday I learned about [the suicide of Aaron Swartz](http://rememberaaronsw.tumblr.com/) an immensely respected figure in freedom and/of information. He was one of the rare people both whose software I used and whose thoughts resonated with me. He got so much done in that short time he was here that his passing places a big burden on the rest of us to continue that work.

I then ended my theater going life by seeing the final [Mightysociety](http://mightysociety.nl/) show in [Frascati](http://theaterfrascati.nl/). More on that when there is time.

Sunday was another Hubbub workday —yes we have a lot to do— with ample visits to [the Village](http://www.thevillagecoffee.nl/) which is really an even funner place then than it is during the week.
