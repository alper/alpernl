title: Packing List

I used to travel between the Netherlands and Germany at least once a month and pretty quickly I grew tired of forgetting things. That's why I made a list (in **bold**, comments added) with the things that I should take or at least consider taking. Whenever I pack my bag, I quickly scan the list and make sure I've covered the bases. Maybe it'll be helpful to you as well.

This and clothes go into a Patagonia MLC bag.

**Take knife off keychain**

I've forgotten to do this more than a couple of times. What makes it weirder still is that TXL/SXF will allow me to fly out with a Swiss army knife but most other airports will not allow me to fly back with one.

**Essentials**

These are things that are irreplaceable and without which a trip usually cannot happen.

- **Laptop**
  Obvious. Macbook Pro 13".
- **Power cable**
  Without this the laptop is pretty worthless. Replacements if you can find them in a local store are upwards of €100.
- **Passport**
  Without this traveling isn't really possible.
- **Boarding cards / tickets**
  You could get these from the airport but I print out everything I can at home.

**Toiletries**

- **Sunblock**
  At some point it becomes silly to buy new sunblock at every sunny destination.
- **Toothbrush, paste** Sometimes I don't bother to bring any and buy them at the destination airport but it's more reliable to pack. Often I also take the head of my electric tooth brush.
- **Lipbalm** I put this on there after I once needed it and paid €11 for a stick at ZRH.
- **Assorted other toiletries**
  This is a pain with only a carry-on. I try to usually depend as much as possible on what is available at my destination.

**Getting around**

These are particularly essential for the Netherlands where you need to bring a card to be able to prove your identity to the various transit systems around.

- **Foreign SIM**
  Often this means just my Dutch T-Mobile SIM. I often have SIMs for destinations outside of Europe but those are so short lived that they aren't reusable.
- **Foreign money / transit cards**
  I have ziploc bags per country with the currency leftovers as well as any transit card (Oyster, Suica) or SIM that may still be usable.
- **Power converters**
  The US and the UK account for most of my trips where these are necessary. I put these in the ziploc bags with the currency.
- **Paperclip**
  I used to need one of these to do the SIM swap. Now I have an Apple SIM pin in the box with all my SIM cards.
- **Keys**
  Keys to my parents place in the Netherlands or any other home/office at the destination.
- **Small backpack**
  The MLC isn't very practical to haul around town. I have a tiny Bach day pack that is super basic but fits everything you could need during a day.
- **Canteen**
  I usually don't bother taking this because of weight and bulk, but it is useful for longer trips.

**Office**

- **VGA dongle**
  Trips usually involve some kind of public speaking and as a speaker you should be self-sufficient. Don't leave this at the venue where you're speaking.
- **Pens**
  I need to carry some quality pens with me. I usually have a four color box of Staedtler fineliners and a couple of Japanese gel pens.
- **Index cards**
  Always useful but don't bring too many because paper is heavy.
- **Business cards**
  Trips are usually for business and people appreciate a nicely designed business card.
- **Headphones with microphone**
  The standard Apple ones will do for most calls.
- **Noise cancelling headphones**
  You need headphones with some noise cancelling effect for during flights. I used to travel with my Sony MDR-7506. They are bulky but if you fly an easyJet to Berlin with those on your head, everybody thinks you're a DJ. Now I prefer to take my Sennheiser CX-300 II in-ears.

**Special wardrobe**

- **Havaianas**
  Bring if the destination is hot.
- **Running shoes, pants**
  Nice to be able to do some sports while traveling.
- **Swimming trunks**
  Always bring these.
- **Sunglasses**
  I always take my Moscot Lemtosh with me.
- **Hiking shoes**
  Whether to bring my decade old pair of Meindls is heavily dependent on the type of trip and the environment.
- **Climbing shoes**
  If there are climbing halls nearby, I'll take these instead of/in addition to running shoes.

**Things to check at home**

- **Washing machine faucet shut**
- **Gas turned off**
- **Lock door**
- **Fridge empty, leave door open**
