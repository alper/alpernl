Easily the most impressive AJAX application I have seen thusfar ([Slashdotted](http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/27/2158240)). The [Zimbra](http://zimbra.com) Collaboration Suite is unbelievably cool and I want it. [Hula](http://hula-project.org) is promising the same and getting there, but these guys are here now and everything looks spick and span. This is really really polished.

Competition is a good thing and with all these different Open Source solutions biting at Exchange's ankles, let's see how long the old man can stand.

It provides a lot of very cool GMail-ish interaction but taken further, solid integration of calendaring, e-mail and other group work features and [Web 2.0](/wiki/index.php/Web_2.0) style combination of different services such as Skype and Google Maps.

Watch [the Flash demos](http://www.zimbra.com/flash_demo/flash_demo.html) to get a feel what is possible and then [try it yourself](http://www.zimbra.com/demo/) at the site.

Another thing they have gotten down right is [blogging](http://www.zimbra.com/blog/) straight forward about what is happening, what they are doing and why. These are smart people.

**Update:** Of course [Jon Udell has more information](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/09/29.html#a1311) about this. Reading the whitepapers only makes me more positive about the technological merit of the project.
