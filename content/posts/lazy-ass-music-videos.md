So I get bored on a Friday night and I want a decent way to watch music videos. Rather than look for a service which provides this ((Surely there are a ton of usable music video players online by now.)), I decided to revive our own toy of a couple years ago, so it's alive (again!): [LastTV](http://lasttv.net/).

More explanation [here](http://lasttv.net/news/2008/11/29/and-were-back/). And I guess this blatantly labels me as a programmer, no?
