The decision by the UN to hold the [WSIS](http://www.itu.int/wsis/) in Tunis almost seems like a deliberate attempt not to be taken seriously by the free world. Holding a summit on internet freedom and participation in a country where [Boing Boing reports](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/16/report_journalists_o.html) journalists are being attacked by the authorities, is pretty paradoxical.

If that is the UN's idea of freedom, do you want to hand over control over the internet to them?

Not to mention the UN is also notoriously corrupt.

I had a [previous post on the WSIS](/blog/study/380) with links to opinion pieces and other news bits.
