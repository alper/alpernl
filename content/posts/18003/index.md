> Not politicians, just career bureaucrats deep in the system. I ask them what their favorite part of the job is. They all say "stability" or "job security" as their #1. It takes 18 months to get the city to permit your shed? They. Do. Not. Care.

All of these examples are things I struggle with also on a daily basis. I live in Berlin where nobody gives a shit about anything. The place is a dump and everybody pretends that it can't be any other way.

It's not hard to see why people don't care. Most people barely have the capacity to get through the day. They don't have it in them to care about something more. The way to get people to care more is to force them with social pressure.
