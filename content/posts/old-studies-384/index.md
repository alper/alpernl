Just finished reading *“Persuasive Technology”* by Fogg. I dumped my notes on the [wiki page](/wiki/index.php/Persuasive_Technology:_Using_Computers_to_Change_What_We_Think_and_Do).

First impression is that it is a very interesting topic but this book is a shallow entry level guide into the field of [captology](http://captology.stanford.edu/).

I have worked out my notes into somewhat coherent ramblings about the book. As I said a good foundation of basic concepts any interaction engineer should be aware of but nothing extremely new or noteworthy.
