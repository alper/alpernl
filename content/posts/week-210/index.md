Updated _maguro_ and setup new branches and development environments. Finished the latest bits of _acapulco_.

Tuesday went to our friends at [Adaptive Path](http://adaptivepath.com) to listen to a lecture by [Andrew Devigal](https://twitter.com/#!/drewvigal).

Spent a day working at [Buro PONY](http://www.buropony.nl). The guys who also made this very nice avatar for Monster Swell:

Wrote a post on Nicholas Carr [“Carr's self-interest”](/dingen/2011/03/carrs-self-interest/) and another one on [Color](/dingen/2011/03/colour/).

Fixed up my fixie and worked a day at the friendly people of [Booreiland](http://www.booreiland.nl).

Also managed to finish [Reality is Broken](http://realityisbroken.org/) to start directly in [Players Unleashed!](http://www.aup.nl/do.php?a=show_visitor_book&isbn=9789089642011)

Sunday migrated _hermosillo_ to [ep.io](http://ep.io) because [djangy](http://djangy.com) despite having promised to run until the end of this month started flaking out already.
