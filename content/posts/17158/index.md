Because it's twenty years old a crusty technology like Django is the fastest way to bootstrap something into production. Get yourself some engineers who are more interested in creating business impact than they are in sprucing up their resume.

Particularly after having seen some people talk about ORMs, the one that Django has is in class entirely of its own that makes most debates here irrelevant.
