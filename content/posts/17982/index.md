I find limited run podcast series that dive deep into a specific topic are some of the best things the medium brings forth.

Here's one from Escape Collective that covers the intersection of a bunch of special interests: bike manufacturing, the pandemic, supply chains and how it all went to hell.

I bought a road bike myself at the end of the pandemic and the supply chain shortages made it so that I'm on a Cube CX bike which is fine but definitely not what I would have gotten if there had been a wide range of bikes to choose from.
