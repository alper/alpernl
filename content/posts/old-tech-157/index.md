The guys from [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org) are going at it relentlessly. The current release is so very much improved from when I last seriously looked at it half a year ago, it's impressive.

At this pace we will probably have complete programming functionality in the browser in one or two years.

I was peeking through the blog when I found two presentations of Dylan's which are great overviews of the current frontier in web programming:

- [Building event-driven user interfaces with Dojo](http://dylan.io/tae/eventui.pdf), lots of tips with stuff you should keep in mind when building massively event driven browser interfaces.
- [Engaging interfaces with Ajax and Comet](http://dylan.io/rwa/), how you can use Ajax events in various tooklits and the different methods currently available to build highly responsive Comet style user interfaces.

Read it, love it.
