I had predicted it to be an Asian country like Singapore or something to first establish an embassy in Second Life. It seems that [Sweden got there first](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/27/sweden_to_be_first_c.html) (the [CNN piece](http://money.cnn.com/2007/01/22/magazines/fortune/whatsnext_secondlife.fortune/index.htm?cnn=yes) linked is quite ok).

Not so big a deal, but interesting vision on behalf of the Swedes. This development could become really interesting of Linden had already open sourced the server component of their software and agreed upon workable and extendable APIs for virtual worlds.

I am reading that they are going in that direction.

Given that, a each country or other group could host their own piece of virtual world with its own special rules, intricacies and facilities for its inhabitants, residents and citizens. Each of these being connected to all the others.

Another big thing missing is a haptic interface to Second Life but it seems Linden has [already built that](http://millionsofus.com/blog/archives/24) interface before even starting on building the world.

The future looks bright with virtual light.
