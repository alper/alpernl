I think “Project-Power” from [this newsletter by Adam Tooze](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-296-project-power-hegemony?utm_source=publication-search) is going to be a useful concept going forward:

> A project in this sense is the historically specific, intentional mobilization of multiple resources around a significant objective on whose success and failure important things depend.

I'm struck mostly by how bad the German government is at this. Every part of the country seems to be fully paralysed.
