A very [ill-conceived shootout between Java and C#](http://www.bentuser.com/article.aspx?ID=323) giving fuel to stupid inflammatory discussions about both platforms.

The paltry benchmarks performed might prove that the .NET platform is faster than Java but the speed is usually only the absolutely most trivial part for language choice. Fast enough is fast enough and there are lots of other more important factors for adoption of a language.

Most of these factors are soft and cannot be easily graphed in Excel. Meaning they are too subtle for a quick score article like I linked above.
