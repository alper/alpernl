This blog will remain to be mainly in English, but the occasional Dutch [^1] post may creep in. [Pascal told me](/dingen/2008/07/evaluate/#comment-545) that it doesn't make a lot of sense to write about locally Dutch things for a Dutch audience in English [^2].

So I have revamped my categories to make them simpler [^3] and added a main category [Language](/dingen/category/lang/) under which to classify my posts by language.

English readers who want a feed of only English language posts should change their subscription to point to: /dingen/category/lang/english/feed/
Dutch readers have [a similar feed](/dingen/category/lang/nederlands/feed/) and bilingual or polyglot readers will not have to change a thing.

[^1]: And maybe also other language
[^2]: Though it doesn't strike me as that strange either. The only ones who'd be left out would be Dutch people who don't speak English, a negligible minority.
[^3]: I'd abused my categories as tags mostly.
