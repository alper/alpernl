The Guardian shows a [clip of the recent armed confrontations](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/05/hebron-settlers-shooting-israel-palestinians) in Hebron due to the riots by Jewish settlers. I had read earlier about [B'Tselem](http://www.btselem.org/English/) handing out small camera's to Palestinians so they could record settler aggression and this is [a clip](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/dec/05/hebron-settlers-shooting-israel-palestinians#send-share) that came out of that program.

This is a precursor to how amateur media are going to become even more important to the dissemination of news and how new media can flatten information asymmetry quite effectively.

One question remains about asymmetry and that is asymmetry in mainstream media reporting. The British press has a reputation to have one of the more fair and balanced reports on the conflict (as does for instance Ha'aretz) ((Though odd that I couldn't find it at [the Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/).)). I am curious if Dutch mainstream media have aired this [fairly graphic clip](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/dec/05/hebron-settlers-shooting-israel-palestinians), I can't find anything on either [the NOS player](http://player.nos.nl/) ((Maybe because the search and the interface of that player are completely atrocious.))or the main NOS site ((Except for [this brief blurb](http://www.nos.nl/nosjournaal/artikelen/2008/12/6/hebronschuttersgevenzichzelfaan.html) about today's events.)) and neither on [RTL Nieuws](http://www.rtl.nl/actueel/rtlnieuws/).

Anybody seen this on Dutch television?
