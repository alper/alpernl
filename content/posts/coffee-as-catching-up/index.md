I was already in the habit of starting my mornings drinking the best coffee in Amsterdam at [Stumptown](http://foursquare.com/venue/1970833) and would regularly chat with [the mayor](http://foursquare.com/user/johanschaap). After planning some morning meetings there, getting an early start, drinking great coffee and having a good conversation with people you'd normally not talk to, proved to be a good idea.

So I opened a collaborative document with my free spots to see if people would be interested in meeting. Early, just for coffee and just for an hour. This is going quite nicely so far, and I'm going to see if I can fill it up for the entire duration of Stumptown's run here in Amsterdam.

I've still got a free spot for next week and will post my schedule for the week after shortly. Signup at the Wave:
