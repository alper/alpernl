XTECH

editor of the SQL standard

XQUERY - language for querying trees of XDM nodes

SQL/XML crosses boundaries between XML and SQL

RDF

RDF in a table a column for every triple

RDF has class membership

RDF is a graph (graphs do not sit well in tables)

OWL is a particular vocabulary of RDF

- relations

- cardinality

- equality

RDF vs. Relational Model

XDM = XPath and XQuery Data Model

RDF vs. XDM

XDM

- tree structured

RDF trees are more general than XDM trees

RDF relations inherent

RDF triples are tiny pieces of data

SPARQL : Protocal and RDF Query Language

matches graph patterns

sql-like syntaxis

SQL Great for finding data from tabular representations.

XQUERY Great for finding data in tree representations, can get complex when many relations have to be traversed

SPARQL Good pattern matching paradigm, especially when relationships are the poitn of the query

SPARQL can be translated to SQL

RDF in relational tables?
