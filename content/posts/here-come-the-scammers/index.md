After having been [locked out of my Instagram](/dingen/2020/08/losing-firstname-on-instagram/) account for months because of wrongful reports, I have just gotten back access to the account for a week or so and I already get the first people reporting me again.

And how do I know that they're doing this? They are in my messages and telling me that they are doing it. This is extremely brazen.

I don't know what they are thinking but let's hope that Instagram has tweaked some of their abuse processes or that my additional protection will pay off.

And that is definitely not the only one. Though the other attempt (below) to retrieve my handle is so delusional that it's almost cute.
