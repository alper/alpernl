Alex Russell recently gave three presentations on JavaScript, one at [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org/2006) and two at [ETECH](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/). Some of it is basic stuff, some of it is more advanced and some of it is controversial.

- [FP and AOP in JavaScript](http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=542) — These little known but quite advanced and useful possibilities of the essentially functional language JavaScript are fun to know and supported well by Dojo.

- [Ajax Tutorial](http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=546) — This should be pretty basic knowledge for anyone involved with Ajax but it still touches on some interesting points.

- [Comet](http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=547) — This re-introduction of an admittedly old technique is probably the most controversial because it introduces another new word. The technique does have some merit and may finally prompt webservers to catch up from their threaded inheritances.

And Simon Willison also gave a [JavaScript tutorial](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/03/07/etech) on ETECH. Useful for beginners and for advanced programmers to touch up their knowledge.
