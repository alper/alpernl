I enjoy James Stanier's newsletter on engineering management a lot. This one is about information processing in organizations, something which will make or break you.

From my observation, the correlation between high functioning people in engineering leadership and usage of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is not 1.0 but it is _very_ high. I use a fairly [tricked out setup](/dingen/2023/12/my-obsidian-home/) myself, but there's value to be had here at all levels.

It's an interesting oversight in the OODA loop sketched out in the article, that the most important step "Orientation" is omitted. Orientation is elusive and hard to pin down which is exactly why it is so key.
