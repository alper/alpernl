Yesterday I attended the weekly [Dota2](http://www.dota2.com/) night at [Meltdown esports bar](http://www.meltdown.bar/berlin) for the first time. I'm looking for people who I can play with regularly because going out into solo queue is becoming a bit tedious and unpredictable. There is a small crowd of people there who play 5v5's in a private lobby against the Meltdown London cafe. It's a lot of shouting and mostly fun.

What strikes me when I go to these get togethers is that however different the people are, there is a shared culture because everybody reads [/r/dota2](http://reddit.com/r/dota2) and watches the same streams and tournaments. It is fairly homogenized everywhere with the exception of China which is insular with its own client, servers and a slew of native language media.

I was also happy to see that the gender balance wasn't as one-sided as I had feared. There's still a long way to go but what I saw at the bar makes me optimistic.
