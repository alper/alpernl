[Garr diggs up pretty good stuff](http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/03/no_excuse_for_t.html) in a very cool essay spectacularly titled: “Let there be stoning!” The following excerpt is a gem:

> "Failure to spend the [presentation] time wisely and well, failure to educate, entertain, elucidate, enlighten, and most important of all, failure to maintain attention and interest should be punishable by stoning. There is no excuse for tedium."

The measure suggested —stoning— may seem a bit too Old Testament-ish in nature but seems about right to me.

Let's institute this at [my university](http://www.tudelft.nl). I know one or two teachers that would hold up.
