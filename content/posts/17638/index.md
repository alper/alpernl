> This week economists have been congratulating themselves on following Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson into institutions. They are, in effect, _proud to have discovered the rest of the social sciences._

>

>
> This year the Riksbank awarded its prize to a treatment of early modern institutions so selective it functions as a bedtime story for capitalists. The good institutions produced prosperity. The bad ones produced misery.
