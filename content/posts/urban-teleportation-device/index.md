I can't say enough how pleased I am to be riding this bike through the city.

I've given her a name but it functions mostly as a teleport to a random location in the city where _t < 15m_. Already being familiar with the topography of Amsterdam is a plus and tearing through the city, riding faster than most people without any effort ((You should see what she does _with_ effort blasting down Berlage bridge.)) is fantastic.

Now comes the more difficult task of keeping this bike in this city.
