I had been eagerly anticipating the [announced developer feature list](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/09/11/firefox15) for Firefox 1.5 for a while now.

I had just read that the beta 2 just had maybe 20 bugs in it and most of them not really serious ones. So I got one at work and installed it. It works like a charm. Nice feel, very stable and I got it to spin some of the canvas demos linked at Simon's page.

The SVG and <canvas> support is cool enough. What is getting me really excited in a more and more AJAX-ish world are the E4X extensions for JavaScript. Having native XML support is just what we need to harness the real power on the client.

**Big Problem:** We cross platform web developers are now faced with something of a problem. Firefox is now very much there in advanced feature support and I expect Safari and Opera to catch up some time soon.

Problem is that I do not know where our sick old man IE stands with this. It seems like they have a difficult enough time implementing security features, tabbed browsing and CSS with their 7.0 release. Hoping they implement stuff like canvas may just be a pipe dream.

Now the question is: for the really cool web applications. Do we just drop support for IE and tell them there are [better and free alternatives](http://www.mozilla.org)?
