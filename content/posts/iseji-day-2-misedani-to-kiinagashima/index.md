Well before 7am I grabbed a quick breakfast at the local FamilyMart and supplies for the day ahead. I'm glad that these things are open 24 hours, but how is this possible? Maybe it's better to not ask any questions (S. [Store owner regrets 'slave contracts' with major Japanese convenience store chain Ministop](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20251114/p2a/00m/0bu/032000c)). I wasn't going to be able to get any kind of coffee at a time like this, but the hotel machine brewed something that wasn't entirely undrinkable.

I ate a pudding and went over the plan again. The start would be the first pass just outside of Odai, [Misesaka](https://www.kodo.pref.mie.lg.jp/en/course/02.html) though "just outside" is relative since getting to the trailhead required quite the trek already.

No rain today for which I'm very thankful which meant there were somewhat more people out and about than yesterday, but still the number is very close to zero. Not that many _ohayo_ s this morning.

To my delight and reassurance at the trailhead there was a box where you can borrow a bear bell and grab a walking stick. You then leave it at the other trailhead where there's a similar arrangement. This is extremely considerate and something that's entirely impossible where I'm from.

Japan is in a bear frenzy at the moment and there's hardly anything else on the news or on anybody's lips. I can report that the bear bell works, because I didn't see one. Or it could have something to do with how on [Kumamap](https://kumamap.com) this part of Japan is entirely empty.

That was beautiful and a bit of an effort. On the other side, [Takihara shrine](https://en.taiki-okuise.jp/view/takiharaguu/) awaited. This was just before 10am and the monks were all up and about. They were moving stuff around for some kind of event and at one of the buildings a bunch monks were busy with the inner sanctuary.

It was cool to see a bunch of men in full regalia doing that stuff even though I don't know (nor probably will ever know) what they were doing. I wondered what the hat with the feather was which turns out to be a [kanmuri with its ei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanmuri_(headwear)#Structure).

As captivating as that was, that didn't change the fact that either I had to catch the 10:25 at [Takihara station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iSaBNohHReihSrbP6) or be stuck here during a 2-3 hour hole in the schedule. Double timing through the town was not fun with legs as sore as mine, but I got there with time to spare. The train itself was manned by one person acting as conductor, driver and ticket seller. When he rolled into the station, I saw him pointing out the driver's window at something. I tried to find the thing he as pointing at until I realized that he was practicing [pointing-and-calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_and_calling) as is common in Japan.

I had considered taking the train to O-Uchiyama but given how my legs were feeling, any bit of walking that could go should go. I got off at Umegadani and made my way to the trailhead for the [Nisaka](https://www.kodo.pref.mie.lg.jp/en/course/03.html) pass.

At Nisaka there was a similar arrangement with the bells and now we also add another dangerous animal to our repertoire: the viper.

This is also where the stunning coastal views started. On the way down there was the occasional choice between the Meiji and Edo routes, one meandering and the other straight and vertical.

I found myself fighting against the sun on the walk out in… end of November. I was definitely picking up some sunscreen that day.

With lunchtime approaching I was eager to make it into town where I had scoped out some restaurants. Being in town at a time when gastronomy is actually open can be a rare and wonderful thing.

I made my way around a small lake where I found [Kappa Club](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8pk2gSR2NpHUAwAT7), a kind of mix between a beach club and a kissaten. There I treated myself to a well-deserved shrimp plate, nama and coffee while I watched several [black kites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_kite) circle over the water. I could not believe how beautiful this entire arrangement was.

A bit further along there was a very promising coffee truck [cafe kiihot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bspa4M8hZWzHzheCA) which sadly was not open today.

It was time for me to find my accommodation but not before stopping at the [Cocokarafine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UdmikCD6wEkVd9HZA) to get some supplies for trail care. A big box Japanese drugstore is something you have to see to believe. It's more of a marvel than many of the sights along the Kumano Kodo. The range of products that was on offer in different areas and the sheer assault on the senses was astounding.

On my way to the guest house, the owner of Kappa found me on the street and showed me around a repurposed [sento that's now a fishery museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jFhGqNXGGytYGsmBA). It's an interesting jumble of stuff he's collected there, but I think the real attraction is in their events.

I'm staying at [Toyohisa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QVg1PBzMZmi6JaWw6) tonight where I have an entire floor to myself. The host wanted to make me dinner, after which I was so full I didn't even think about walking anywhere for anything else. My legs are very grateful. Except for this extremely dangerous stairs I had to go down at night to visit the lavatory.

The stats for the day say 26,86km and some 34k steps ( [strava1](https://www.strava.com/activities/16568003972), [strava2](https://www.strava.com/activities/16569422796)).

While writing this I found the video that Craig Mod posted about his day along the route and I can say that's a picture perfect depiction of how my day went as well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QL5GB2vdS8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QL5GB2vdS8)

I can't believe this is only day two. More tomorrow.
