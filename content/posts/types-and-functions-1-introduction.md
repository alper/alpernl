I got sick of it and I want to learn the weirder stuff of functional programming seriously now.

I'm under the impression that these are fundamentally very simple things that people overcomplicate either because they don't really understand them or because they are poor communicators.

I think it should be possible to explain the concepts and their use without any jargon, so I asked for sources:

- [The Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/)
- [Functional Programming in Javascript](http://reactivex.io/learnrx/)
- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

I'm now working with the Mostly Adequate Guide which starts of really good but at some point also dives off into mathematical weirdness. Let's see how far I get.
