I loved this summary of Julie Zhuo's new book “The Making of a Manager”(excellent points in there about one-on-ones, self-awareness, delegation and growth) and I can't wait to read the entire thing.

> _“The perspective you have changes everything. With a fixed mindset, your actions are governed by fear — fear of failure, fear of judgement, fear of being found out as an imposter,”says Zhuo. With a growth mindset, you’re motivated to seek out the truth and ask for feedback because you know it’s the fastest path to get you where you want to go.”_
