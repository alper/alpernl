The second day started off with a talk about [Free by Jerry Michalski](http://www.reboot.dk/artefact-5420-en.html) which reminded me a lot of the topics that I had covered the previous day in my talk. Jerry's talk being in the main hall made this turn out a lot differently than my talk.

David Recordon followed with a talk [about the open web](http://www.reboot.dk/artefact-5417-en.html) and reminded us that not that much has changed in the last six months since I saw him on the same topic in Berlin. The big social conglomerates that have each other in a chokehold make for glacial progress.

I dropped in on the [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) workshop which was a very nice introduction into building electronic stuff. Because I was already somewhat familiar and I wanted the freedom to bounce around the conference, I hadn't registered but I did get some questions in to further my own ideas.

[Joshua's talk](http://www.reboot.dk/artefact-3980-en.html) proved to be one of the best of the conference —with this [great quote](http://twitter.com/factoryjoe/statuses/845010411)— marred slightly by the fact that his partner could not make it for a more complete stage presence. [His work](http://www.regional-office.com/) and vision how technology works towards freedom is very relevant and interesting though we usually stare ourselves blind at Silicon Valley and the likes.

After the conference we made a yearly chaotic meetup somewhere in the city trying to get something to eat more or less succesfully after which we made our way to Vega. The party in the bar was quickly replaced with a party outside with tipping beers and music where everybody had a great time. Even the arrival of police could not really stop our party.

The next day I was going to get some coffee at Kafeplantagen when I remembered that some people were having a post-Reboot brunch at [Pussy Galore's Flying Circus](http://www.pussy-galore.dk/) ((Yeah, the name is for real.)). I was a bit hesitant to join after having already spent two days with these people but I'm glad I went inside. I got to catch up with Chris Messina, [Brynn Evans](http://brynnevans.com/) and Janetti Chon and talk about the differences between the USA and Europe.
