The literature study part of my graduation has taken long enough both schedule wise and with regards to the effort invested. I have a next milestone deadline this week on the report and I am not planning to spend much more time on it after that.

Most of the literature on the topic really has no new insights at all. It is usually either *d'oh* truisms or vagueness all over the place. I do not really get the feeling I am learning much (well, that's new…) compared to the time invested.

And I like to read this kind (any kind) of stuff, but when it is forced it immediately becomes much less appealing and much more boring to me.

As an alternative I have started reading [‘Benim Adım Kırmızı’](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375706852/002-8265165-7409648?v=glance&n=283155) which is stunning from page one.

It seems like I am wasting my time on this stuff only to produce more paper of my own. I am eager to start doing something real. Fortunately I have an opportunity to do somethin really fun (more on that later).
