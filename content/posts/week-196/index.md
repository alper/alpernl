Last week was mired by the flu which made it a bad week for production (and only slightly less bad for meetings).

Some notable stuff did happen, however.

We kicked off project _Maguro_ which is going to cause our all star team a lot of work —and a lot of fun— in the new year (see [Kars's Week 182](http://leapfrog.nl/blog/archives/2010/12/17/week-182/)).

Tuesday night we had the fourth [UX Book Club Amsterdam](http://twitter.com/#!/uxbcams) discussing the book [Game Design Workshop](http://books.google.com/books?id=OjIYWtqWxtAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=game+design+workshop&source=bl&ots=AFJ29Z-PYV&sig=7s3donb4RWdBmEffWrBWCB5g3io&hl=en&ei=iacQTfeKFcuv4Aarp72GAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false). [eBuddy](http://www.ebuddy.com) hosted us and it was a lot of fun both talking about game design, how it pertains to interaction design and reminiscing about old games.

Wednesday [Urbanode](http://www.urbanode.net) was launched officially, my write-up: [Urbanode: first steps in environmental control](/dingen/2010/12/urbanode-first-steps-in-environmental-control/)

Friday I met as part of a delegation by [Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl) with people from the city of Amsterdam and the [Waag](http://www.waag.org/). Lots of stuff going to happen with regards to open data and apps in Amsterdam in 2011.
