Just to file this for my receipts here. Marina Weisband asks whether you would build a website for a small organization using Wix.

https://chaos.social/@afelia/109631019638041653

Look at the replies all of which are somewhere between: "Datenschutz this", "you can get sued for that", "be afraid", "don't do it". It's so incredibly sad that the people in Germany created this absurd swamp where the best answer for most people is to just opt out of the internet.

And then at the same time these people will gaslight me by saying that "Datenschutz isn't the problem". Of course Datenschutz isn't the problem. The problem are the infinite number of true idiots in this country who will talk about nothing other than Datenschutz.
