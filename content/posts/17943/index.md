I love Github Projects for tracking work. It's close to the code and engineers understand it natively. I feel you can deliver features of any size with it if you work with the tool.

The only thing that's a bit annoying is the lack of improvements from Github. There's a bunch of quality of life features I'm used to from other tools that would really make a difference. But now with LLMs we don't have to settle.

I asked Cursor to write me a user script that adds a "Create Follow-up Task" button (that I used a lot on Asana) to issues on Github. It did a reasonable enough job that I could tweak and then have something working for me. I could write this myself of course but the hurdle of figuring out the format and the wiring felt like a blocker.
