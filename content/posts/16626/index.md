I was amazed at how closely this article about product development at Facebook tracks with how I approach it: "PMs are 100% accountable for the results of your team."

I'm doubling as EM/PM for a bit and engineers in my team fully own some of our projects. This is a combination of high demand and high trust that I think is working out well.
