Stories of Microsoft changing are doing the rounds, but one thing they don't seem to be able to change is their inability to release Vista ([press release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/mar06/03-21WindowsVistaDeliveryPR.mspx)).

[Another delay to early 2007](http://gigaom.com/2006/03/21/microsoft-delays-consumer-windows-vista/) leaves a window of about one more year for [Apple](http://www.macosx.nl/?p=showarticle&art_id=2261) and Linux to make their forays.

[Om](http://gigaom.com/2006/03/21/microsoft-delays-consumer-windows-vista/) has more dirt.
