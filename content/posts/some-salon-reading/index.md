Never enough time for reading, but thanks to [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) got around to reading some stuff that was due coincidentally both of these are from Salon:

Book review: [“An End to Evil”by David Frum and Richard Perle](http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2004/01/30/frum_perle/index.html) — Very interesting to read these neocon perspectives in an time when the world and America have shifted away from a position when those points of view were desirable and feasible.

[Maxed out](http://www.salon.com/health/sex/urge/2000/01/18/hustler/index.html) — Interesting take on pornography and how it reflects on society.
