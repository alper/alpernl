Two years after [I harrangued the Dutch national railways](/dingen/2009/03/op-radio-online-tegen-de-ns/) on radio about their closed data policy and [debunked all their arguments](/dingen/2009/04/een-soort-van-antwoord-van-de-ns/) why they would not open up this data.

This month the [NS](http://www.ns.nl) opened up their data via [an official API](http://www.ns.nl/cs/Satellite/reizigers/api). And one of the first applications is [this live train map of the Netherlands](http://kubus.mailspool.nl/spoorkaart/) which is just wonderful. It simply exposes something that we knew implicitly and displays it very fluently.

This is just one of the many open data dominoes falling this year, but a very nice one and yes it looks like victory is within our grasp.
