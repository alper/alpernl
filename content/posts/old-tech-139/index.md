An interesting [article in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/arts/14heff.html?ei=5090&en=3941ff903992e111&ex=1305259200&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all) about the increasing popularity of Media Immersion Pods.

It's probably typically Japanese but Japan is usually a precursor of trends we are going to see in the near future. People in other parts of the world may have different ways to unwind, but for an increasing number of people ‘escape’ online is becoming more and more common.
