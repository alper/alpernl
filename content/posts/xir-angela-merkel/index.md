Turkish MC [XiR](https://www.facebook.com/xirgokdeniz/) has a new trap song out with the noteworthy title Angela Merkel. There is even somebody with a Merkel mask in the video.

{{< youtube id="5Ci2kwIob6c" >}}

The video has a quick and dirty German subtitle bundled with it which you can turn on and read.

In the spirit of international relations, I will translate to English the hook of the song ( [lyrics on Genius](https://genius.com/Xir-gokdeniz-angela-merkel-lyrics)). The rest of the song is either not that interesting or I'm missing out on a lot of inside baseball. Either way, I won't try it.

> Angela Merkel
> Schengen yok
> Karaköy'e sen gel
>
> Bozulur dengen
> Yol aldı yengen
> Karaköy'e sen gel
> Angela Merkel

> Angela Merkel
> There is no Schengen
> You come down to Karaköy
>
> You'll lose your senses
> Your woman's gone ((The German translation says: “Deine Freundin hat dich verlassen”.))
> You come down to Karaköy
> Angela Merkel

I can't make much more of it other than that the mythologization of Angela Merkel continues. I'm curious what the German foreign office thinks about that.
