So this was announced: A Netherlands wide apps competition called [Apps voor Nederland](http://www.appsvoornederland.nl/) was [announced by several ministries](http://www.appsvoornederland.nl/nieuws/open-data-is-goed-voor-de-economie) today at [PICNIC](http://picnicnetwork.org/). Minister for the interior [Donner delivered a video message](http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/bzk/documenten-en-publicaties/toespraken/2011/09/15/toespraak-minister-donner-bij-de-opening-van-het-open-dataportaal.html) as well.

The organization I'm involved with, Hack de Overheid will be organizing two events end of this year with the first one being an [open hacking event on October 4th](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/2011/09/4-oktober-open-data-hackathon/) and the second being a Code Camp in Amsterdam end of November.

The message [I am promoting](https://twitter.com/#!/alper/status/114273989303599104) is that this is the time to get on board and get your data out and start building civic apps. This is the last moment in the cycle that any of this is going to be at all special, innovative or unboundedly fun. After we're done with this event most of the ground will be covered, hearts will be won and anybody talking about open data will be hailed with a ‘Been there, done that!’

Of course there will still be a dozen years of hard work for a great many people to change our institutions, build businesses on top of usable humane applications and educate a populace. There may even be fun to be had here and there, but you would be a fool not to get on board right here right now and help us kick this off.

See you October 4th.
