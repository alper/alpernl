Ton Armitage - Telling Stories: what Homer, Dickens and Marvel Comics can teach your (social) software

Reboot8

social sofware design through the lens of serial fiction

Serial Publishing

Dickens's books were published in monthly installments

Pickwick Club

For the publisher you recoupe your costs faster

More people can afford it

More people can review

It makes the story more manageable and the serial structure enforces structure.

2. Epic

telling the same story over and over again

Homer's huge stories: Illiad + Odyssey

epithet

convention

meter

formula

Story you keep telling over and over again: Sign-up form

Only ask stuff you need to know

Profiles should be different

Parallel stories in multiple accounts

Don't assume too much continuity, it's not that important, keeping writing is

3. Retroactive Continuity

adding new information to historical material

deliberateyl changing previously established facts

Marvel: Crisis on infinite earths

4. Fiction

telling untruths to make a better sturry

Truth: something with no deliberate dishonesty

The Doorbells of Florence

playful fiction on forums, MMORPG

Identity

Personas are very important, real names not so much

Expect people to give false details

Kaycee Nicole Swenson, lying pretending to be a girl dying of leukemia

There's no truth or fiction flag on the internet.

People can detect if stuff is untrue or unhealthy or so.

5. Telling the story

Theh poet should in fact speak as little as possible in his own person since in what he himself says he is not an imitator.

Plot vs. narrative

Video games make terrible films, 'the narrative is always up for grabs'

Breedster

Conclusion

Tell stories

Fiction can creep in
