This week was the week where we were in full sprint for the pilot launch of KAIGARA. Besides that we had a dinner off [NEXT](http://nextberlin.eu/) with some people involved and some speakers. What I managed to catch from NEXT's program while working was nothing short of splendid. [Bruce Sterling's talk](http://nextberlin.eu/2013/04/bruce-sterling-fantasy-prototypes-and-real-disruption/) has been shared widely and I'm eagerly awaiting Anab Jain's to be published as a video ( [the slides are already there](http://www.superflux.in/blog/newnormal-revisited)).

On Thursday I managed to set aside a bit of time to go to the local multiplayer picknick at Amaze. The [Amaze Indie Connect](http://www.amaze-indieconnect.de/) is the most fun event of the Berlin game scene and it always gets lots of very cool people to come out. Just sitting at the same table as [Terry Cavanagh](https://twitter.com/terrycavanagh) and [Michael Brough](https://twitter.com/smestorp) left me a bit star-struck:

 [![Just played a bunch of Samurai Gunn. It's an incredible amount of fun.](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8117/8680754653_615dcd6099_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8680754653/ "Just played a bunch of Samurai Gunn. It's an incredible amount of fun. by illustir, on Flickr")

It was also nice to see lots of old friends who I manage to see a couple of times a year. My highlight of Amaze was to be able to play Samurai Gunn. This game isn't available yet and the video I'm going to post below does not nearly do it justice. It is one of the most gripping multiplayer combat games I've played to date.

On Friday I had breakfast at the Sheperditchi ((I'll explain later what this exactly means.)) and then on Saturday it was off to Paris for [CHI](http://chi2013.acm.org/) for the [designing gamification](http://gamification-research.org/chi2013/) workshop run by [Sebastian Deterding](http://codingconduct.cc/).
