Monday I went off exploring a [fort](http://forteiland.nl) for an upcoming [Hack de Overheid](http://hackdeoverheid.nl) event. The industrial scenery and weather at the sea locks of IJmuiden was positively apocalyptic that day.

The week was spent a bit catching up from a cold and ticking off stuff before a week of Berlin (staying at [Your Neighbours](http://yourneighbours.de/)) and a week of off the grid R&R in the Alps. So a frantic pace here and there.

Tuesday we went for a technical house call in the Hague:

Kilian [wrote up his work on Statlas](http://kilianvalkhof.com/2011/web/statlas-beta-release/). Expect more on that after the Summer lull.

My presentation on [CHI Sparks 2011](http://chi-sparks.nl/) was put online ( [thanks Yohan Creemers](https://twitter.com/#!/ylab/status/92868975934976000)) and quite pleased with how that turned out:

[Chi Sparks 2011: Code 4 - A large scale game for organizational change](http://vimeo.com/26477007) from [Chi Nederland](http://vimeo.com/chinederland) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

There seems to be [a VOLUME magazine out](http://volumeproject.org/blog/2011/07/19/volume-28-internet-of-things/) in which are incorporated [our contributions](/dingen/2011/05/week-216/) about how architecture and the ‘internet of things’ should mesh. I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but I'm curious as to the results.

James Burke and I made plans about [the Chokepoint Project](http://chokepointproject.net/) and an upcoming visit to [the CCC Camp](http://events.ccc.de/2010/08/10/chaos-communication-camp-2011/) in Finowfurt.

A review I wrote for [nrc.next](http://www.nrcnext.nl) about the documentary game: [The Cat and the Coup](http://coup.peterbrinson.com/) (about the British/American coup d'état in Iran) saw print in a strongly reduced form. Expect a more elaborate version of that to hit [Bashers](http://bashers.nl) in the next month.

I wrote a brief thing about how my ideas about Amsterdam urban development are supported by Jane Jacobs seminal work: [“Jane Jacobs and the city of Amsterdam”](/dingen/2011/07/jane-jacobs-and-the-city-of-amsterdam/) and also wrote a small something over at Monster Swell [to commemorate the 10e6 Foursquare](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2011/07/10000000-foursquare-users/) users milestone and Amsterdam's small role in that.

With all of that done, it was into the night train to Berlin for a Friday very early morning arrival.
