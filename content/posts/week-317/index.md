The week before this on Monday (almost two weeks ago), I went to a lecture by Graham Harman. [Notes on that](/dingen/2013/04/graham-harman-at-the-universitat-der-kunste/) were blogged in a timely fashion.

That week also involved a one-day trip to Munich to present on the work we did for a client there. More on that on the Hubbub blog in due course.

Thursday I worked at the [Kreuzberg Academy for Nerdery and Tinkering](https://foursquare.com/v/kant--kreuzberg-academy-for-nerdery-and-tinkering/51238e70e4b04e6a13aaddc9) next door. I really love how Oranienstraße is coming together as a creative technological hub of import in Berlin.

The rest of the week was used developing [Ripple Effect](https://www.playrippleeffect.com/) and with maintenance on [GidsGame.nl](http://www.gidsgame.nl/).
