After seeing Django I came upon a new Python framework that combines the existing web technology into a nice package: [Turbogears](http://www.turbogears.org/).

I have not had the time to play with either Django or Turbogears but I am quite familiar (and happy) with [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/) one of the components of Turbogears.

Briefly reading what other people are saying about it ([Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/search/turbogears+django), [Google](http://search.blogger.com/?q=turbogears+django&btnG=Search+Blogs&hl=en&ui=blg)) gives the same impression as [Subway](http://subway.python-hosting.com/) and [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/). Light and very accessible frameworks to quickly develop a site with ([Wiki's in 20 minutes](http://www.turbogears.org/docs/wiki20/index.html) are killer).

Between the lines I read a lot of positive stuff about Zope 3.1 but like most people I have been planning to but I still have not gotten around to learning that.
