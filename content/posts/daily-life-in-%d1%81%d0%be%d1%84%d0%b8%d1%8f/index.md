It's nice to have friends who are pushing their bounds photographically to try and improve their skill and to see them improve leaps and bounds as a result of that.

One such friend is Mony and [during his yearly holiday](http://straboh.uber.com/blogs/Release_a_set_of_photographs_of_Sofia_on_Flickr.html) ((Or should I say pilgrimage.)) to Bulgaria he has produced a very nice set of street photography out of Sofia:

Picture by [Mony Nedkov](http://www.flickr.com/people/straboh/) from [the set Sofia](http://www.flickr.com/photos/straboh/sets/72157606560417919/).

For me it's of particular interest to see pictures of a city neighboring my love Istanbul. I have just [this one](http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/onblack.php?id=1356161009) picture I would call a good street photography shot. The effort it takes to get even halfway decent shots is staggering.

On a different photograpic note, I've brought away the 120 film I shot [this weekend](http://www.dopplr.com/trip/alper/236146) for development. I hope the repairs on [my Yashica](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/2744133046/) worked out and the pictures are in focus. Shooting manual metered medium format film is a very different experience and pace than I'm used to from my 350D and something I could very well get used to. The digital set is still being edited and should go (partly) up tonight.
