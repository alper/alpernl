After having kicked out [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) and moved to a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) generated static site, next up are two other useless subscriptions that aren't doing anything other than costing me money:

1.  [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com)

    Flickr has not generated any positive interactions in years. You can keep posting your pictures there but the place is pretty much dead. The main reasons for being on Flickr Pro were mostly nostalgia, habit and the hosting of the embedded pictures.

    During the move to Hugo I pulled all Flickr pictures into the offline bundle so not that much stuff should break. Also breakage is an essential part of the internet.

    I'd like to see if I can pull my data and put it into an [Immich](https://immich.app) server, but otherwise I'm fine with having a local archive of everything and calling it done.

2.  [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/)

    I'm paying €100/year for the privilege of being able to keep [Cuppin.gs](https://cuppin.gs) on the App Store. That is a benefit, but the amount of money is low-key extortionate.

    It does not make that much sense for Cuppings to be an iOS app anymore and I've started [a push](https://codeberg.org/alpercugun/cuppings/src/branch/main/frontend) to turn it into a location aware web application. When I get that done, I can stop paying Apple and leave the closed system for good.

More services that I should exit but that are not that pressing:

* Goodreads
* Spotify
* Komoot
