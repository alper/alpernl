Not verified but an interesting data point in how German civil servants don't have that attractive a position and can get better deals working indirectly for the people 'at the engines of the global economy'.

That makes you wonder why the engines of the global economy are not here or if they are why it's not possible to pay civil servants competitive both in compensation and in job satisfaction. To be able to get the best talent and create the kind of state capacity that justifies having a state, the best people working in the civil service should be paid competitively with the top of society.
