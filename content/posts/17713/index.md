Reading these database migration stories is usually interesting, but what I found especially noteworthy here is that all of the Django features they used to make it easy for themselves have been in there for more than a decade.

That's the kind of maturity that maybe makes a technology like that not that appealing to work with for new developers but it is also a maturity that lets you get real work done.
