Last week was crazy hectic, notwithstanding the fact that I was ill at the same time. Sickness and deadlines are not fun, but thankfully both were survived.

What had to be done was the prototype iPhone app for the first playtest of [saba](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/?s=saba&searchsubmit=Search). Which was finished in the nick of time with programming sprints that ended later and later into the night.

Then it was a train on Friday to Amsterdam for the [Open State](http://hackdeoverheid.nl) board meeting followed by the more general strategy day on Saturday. A lot of fun was had and important things were discussed during the weekend (see [this write-up by Natasja Trifkovic](http://www.opencoop.nl/?p=498)), which makes it all worthwhile, but some downtime would be welcome at this point.
