So the Instagram handle that [I thought I had lost](/dingen/2020/08/losing-firstname-on-instagram/) was returned to me suddenly last week (thanks to a friend). Not sure whether I'll get to keep it this time round, but let's try.

At least this time I've copied most of my follows to my backup account and I'll see if I can make a data backup at one point or another.
