Last week was the week things got into gear again for 2011.

Monday I built a quick javascript mashup with [the new API by NOS](http://open.nos.nl) called [‘Ons Nieuws’](http://monsterswell.com/projects/onsnieuws/) (Our News): [http://monsterswell.com/projects/onsnieuws/](http://monsterswell.com/projects/onsnieuws/) inspired by the trend in glanceable display websites. The write-up is here: [“Glanceable news using the new NOS API”](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2011/01/glanceable-news-using-the-new-nos-api/)

Blogged about the catch-22 in Dutch open data: [“Bloggers, transparency and our Catch-22”](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2011/01/bloggers-transparency-and-our-catch-22/) [Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/) is also busy bringing a whole lot of awesome to open data in 2011. Stay tuned and look over there for announcements.

Started setup for the next iteration of [Dutchstats](http://monsterswell.com/blog/category/projects/dutchstats/). Kicked off the technical part of Dutchstats (the renderer) with [Kilian Valkhof](http://kilianvalkhof.com/), drafted a set of functional and non-functional requirements and setup [a project repository](https://github.com/MonsterSwell).

Did a bunch of deployment stuff to create a rather complex django site for _mérida_ which is a relief to get up and running.

Switched prototyping _maguro_ from [twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/) to [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) because that is still the technology I'm most familiar with (prototyping should not be about technology acquaintance). We had a meeting with the team and after some discussion we played a game concept that was pretty fun.

Friday we had a geek breakfast with [Peter](http://twitter.com/pr1001) and [Taco](http://twitter.com/tacoe) having a full English at [Greenwoods](http://amsterdam.unlike.net/locations/304746-Greenwood-s). The food was good as was the conversation. We should really do this regularly.

Then I spent the rest of the day with [James Burke](http://lifesized.net) working on the new version of the [Hack de Overheid](http://hackdeoverheid.nl) site.

In the weekend I picked up a second hand [Grote Bosatlas](http://www.bosatlas.nl/) 51e editie for a real bargain. It still is a fantastic cornucopia of maps and infographics. Leafing through it made me all nostalgic like I used to do back in school exploring far away places on the map.
