I've never exactly followed any framework but instead, I played it by ear and mixed and matched what worked best from wherever I could find it. That's always a bit bothersome (but easily solved) when people want to work with the exact definition of something.

Formalizing that approach as SWARMing (Scaling Without A Religious Methodology) is an interesting twist indeed.
