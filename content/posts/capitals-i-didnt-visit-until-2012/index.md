One recap of 2012 which was an odd year what with the international move and all. Still in the second half I managed to get **a lot** of travel in leaving aside the almost monthly trips to Amsterdam by train. Dopplr unfortunately does not give me [a total amount of kilometers](http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/alper/public) travelled for 2012 anymore.

The funny thing is that I visited a lot of capitals of countries that I hadn't visited before even though I may have visited the country.

**To Madrid in February:** I had been to Spain often but never visited either Madrid or Barcelona.

**To Athens in June:** I had not ever been to Greece at all, so this was all new. A lot more fun than Madrid by the way.

**To Paris in July:** I'd been to France a couple of times but never to Paris yet.

**To Helsinki in July:** Another new capital and country, a visit which was very enjoyable both because of the company and because of the immense livability of the city.

**To Beijing in October:** A long overdue visit to China which was even more elucidating than it was enjoyable.

**Not to (Canberra) in October:** Though I did visit both Melbourne and Sydney which don't count.

**To Moscow in December:** A nice combination of business and personal visits and a welcome confrontation with the weirdness of Russia.

Which makes my visited countries map look like this:
