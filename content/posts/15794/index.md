“the resilience of a system corresponds to its adaptive capacity tuned to the future.”

https://lorinhochstein.wordpress.com/2019/08/20/tuning-to-the-future/

“While counterfactual reasoning helps restore our feeling that the world makes sense, the problem with it is that it doesn’t help us get better at avoiding or dealing with future incidents. The reason it doesn’t help is that counterfactual reasoning gives us an excuse to avoid the messy problem of understanding how we missed those obvious-in-retrospect actions and signals in the first place.”

The writings of Lorin Hochstein about resilience engineering are immensely valuable and illuminating. It's nice to be able to read the thinking of people who are current with the cutting edge of a profession.
