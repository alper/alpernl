Read two more papers on the subject.

[One](/wiki/index.php/Virtual_Communities:_Abort%2C_Retry%2C_Failure%3F) quite negative about the virtualization of community and its impact on the public sphere.

The [other](/wiki/index.php/The_Networked_Nature_of_Community:_Online_and_Offline) quite positive about the experiences advanced internet users have integrating the internet into their day to day social life.
