Barcamp London seems to have been a complete blast understandably. I've been reading the reports but [from Jeremy's blog](http://adactio.com/journal/1171) I found these two nuggets:

**Werewolf** the game I knew as [Mafia](http://www.princeton.edu/~mafia/) seems to have risen to popularity again in select nerd circles.

I have read and loved the rules for some time now. The only question now is to get 15+ quality nerds together to play this.

**Pechalicious** this [mashup of Pecha Kucha and del.icio.us](http://delicious.salted.com/) is pure gold. If you want to fill some time or you want to answer the question ‘What have you been doing lately?’ in an interesting way. Superb.

I just watched my last 20 links and I can imagine myself telling a half decent story about them.
