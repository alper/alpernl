I had been kicking around some stuff about wikis when on Rudolf van der Berg posted [an article on Frankwatching about wiki practice within companies](http://www.frankwatching.com/archive/2006/07/14/special_wiki_beste_kennistool_/). The article is arguably a bit sloppy and neglects to even mention [Mediawiki](http://www.mediawiki.org) but the resulting discussion is more than worthwhile and shows that the topic is very much alive.

I added [my five cents](http://www.frankwatching.com/archive/2006/07/14/special_wiki_beste_kennistool_#alper-0607201028) concering Mediawiki and my experiences implementing a wiki within [TOPdesk](http://www.topdesk.com).

These experiences have been overwhelmingly positive. I am currently preparing a presentation for our consultants and our company at large concerning wikis and wiki principles (slides will be posted in the near future).

But then reading around a bit I encountered JP Rangaswami's blog —I talked to him briefly during the [Reboot](http://reboot.dk) boat tour but I regretfully missed his session— and found his post on this subject: [Four Pillars: Does Social Software help Enterprises Dumb Down?](http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2006/07/04/four-pillars-does-social-software-help-enterprises-dumb-down/).

I can only second James Governor's comment: JP is awesome.
