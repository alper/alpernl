> Enter prebuilds: pools of codespaces, fully cloned and bootstrapped, waiting to be connected with a developer who wants to get to work. The engineering investment we’ve made in prebuilds has returned its value many times over: we can now create reliable, preconfigured codespaces, primed and ready for GitHub.com development in 10 seconds.

I have done and seen a bunch of work in the space of local development environments looking at what Github has done: the problem is very hard and making the end user experience this good looks like it has taken an inordinate amount of effort.
