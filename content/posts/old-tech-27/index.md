It's nice to see [more dynamism](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/11/01/Beyond-Java) in the web application sphere championed by smart people.

I would love for serious web applications to move away from their sole focus on Java to more fun and free languages such as Python or Ruby. I am not the only person thinking programming should and could be fun, am I?
