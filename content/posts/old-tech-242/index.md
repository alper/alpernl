I told [Cris](http://fourstarters.com/cristiano/) that now he's a London resident he should not miss the number one geek/tech event in the area: [Barcamp London](http://upcoming.org/event/138806/).

Judging from [his stories](http://ibbydibby.com/cbetta/blog/?p=26) and [those of others](http://adactio.com/journal/1259/) and from [the pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/barcamplondon2/interesting/), this was a top event and I regret very much not being there.

This makes me feel the itch for the next version of the Dutch Barcamp. Anybody out there wanna help me scratch?
