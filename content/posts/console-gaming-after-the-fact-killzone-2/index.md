Extremely crude but a decent shooter nonetheless. Can be a bit of a slough at times but now that I've played more from the genre that seems to be par for the course.

The writing is so bad that you seriously wonder where they get it. The target audience for these kind of games does not seem to want much more. Thankfully the science fiction setting where you fight a pure evil removes some of the moral issues that other games in the genre carry.
