[John Ganz on nationalism and reducing humans to insects](https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/the-trap).

> _A warm, comfortable death for you, and a violent, cold, and terrible death for the other guy. It choses being subsumed in a mass to avoid the terrible difficulty of remaining human that rises to the fore in tragic moments like this one. When I die, I hope it will be here in New York, the promised land, surrounded by my brothers: all the different peoples of the world._

> Above all, **I refuse to become an insect or look on others as insects.**
