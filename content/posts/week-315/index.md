We're in the middle of a big project, so pretty much everything is that right now. In between some small things happen, but we're rather busy shipping right now.

I did post the answer to the most frequently asked question I get, which is how you actually pronounce my name:

And in between stuff I dropped in on this book presentation at c-base, which was pretty weird:
[![Hacker artist book presentation with buzzword bingo: ‘business, art, disruption, entrepreneurs, networkers’](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8097/8592459749_b44df0f470.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8592459749/ "Hacker artist book presentation with buzzword bingo: ‘business, art, disruption, entrepreneurs, networkers’ by illustir, on Flickr")

And I had [a strange encounter with Berlin police](http://berlinbikepaths.tumblr.com/post/46927126119/bring-out-the-dashcams-for-bicycles) who it seems cannot look around them.

Furthermore I did some account maintenance for [Open State](http://openstate.eu/), getting things in order for our new CEO who arrives next week.
