This latest [Screening Room on IronPython](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/screenroom/ironpython_flv.html) shows some great stuff about how IronPython can be used to leverage all of Microsoft's technologies on Windows.

There is too much good stuff in there to list. One was the live creation and editing of WPF GUIs from a Python command line. Another one was a Python project in Visual Studio where porting a Python fuction to C# was a simple cut-n-paste and showed both a performance jump and cross language debugging.

It's only too bad I don't do Windows. Let's see how this combination plays out on the Mono side. Being able to build Python/Winforms cross platform applications could be interesting.

**Update:** This discussion is branching off into much more nuanced and interesting discussions. Jon Udell follows up with [a best of both worlds strategy](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/09/06.html#a1519). And some more [musings on Enterprise Class Software](http://blogs.iona.com/vinoski/archives/000347.html) and tochnology adoption by Steve Vinoski.

**Update:** And now Java folk can also [play along with Ruby](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/09/07/JRuby-guys). Interesting division, this Python.NET and Java+Ruby.
