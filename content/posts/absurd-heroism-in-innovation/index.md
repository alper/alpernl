Sjors Timmer writes [a nice piece about the futility of innovation](http://svirsk.org/2010/01/on-horses-technology-and-the-monster-of-innovation/) and the inevitability of failure.

He says:

> “Who in their right mind would ever want to be sacrificed in the name of innovation, who in full knowledge would accept an seventy hour work week for unhealthy low pay, who educated by the best would spend their days in cheap office space with Spartan furniture.”

Sjors comes to the same conclusion, but I would answer (free after [Camus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism#Albert_Camus)) that both choices are absurd, both being a cog in a cubicle of bureaucracy and the hopeless railing against the windmills of the upstart.

But if both are absurd, you ought to accept that and choose the more glorious one.
