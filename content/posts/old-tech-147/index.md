Alexander Kjerulf - Let's Reboot Democracy

Reboot8

Democracy and Politics are broken.

Has written a manifesto (in Danish)

Has some ideas

Needs people to work with him on this idea

Small group of people making the decisiions

Large group of people are inactive

("The greatest threat to democracy is an inert populace.")

More people vote in American Idol than they do in American Presidential Elections

Did a quick stretching exercise.

NY Times: Politics has become a  game of meaningless, mindless battles, conducted by unscrupulous methods and peole designed to transform even the most serious policy debates into sport. --Al Gore

==BEGIN BRAINSTORM with NOVEMBERBORN.NET==

Mark Rutte heeft gewonnen = goed

Voor stemmen hoef je niet zoveel te kunnen/weten.

Niet erg. --Wisdom of Crowds

Makkelijke manipulatie door media en andere hypes. Waan van de dag. Negatieve tendens. = probleem

Angst voor terrorisme, ANGST. Gevoeligheid voor negatieve campagnes gebaseerd op angst.

Lack of attention to digital civil liberties and privacy of citizens. = BAD

Short term vision. Lack of attention to longer term things.

==END INTERMEZZO==

Brain storm on what is wrong with politics.

List of bad stuff:

Lack of good participation

No real options

Too expensive

No accountability from politicians

Risk-taking costs votes

Afraid to be unpopular

Lack of long-term vision

Lack of good leadership

Lack of transparency

Playing on fears

Lobbyists

Monopoly of political parties on the system

What politicians represent people

Media = race

People dont want to hear truth

Votecrs don't like decisive decisions

Spin and simpliciation

Corporate domination

Frustration over low voter turnout

Alex's ideas:

-The media, the mass media distorts

-Not transparent, how do politicians reach the decisions they make

-Political parties, made sense 50 years ago, people are all over the place, don't have clear cut boundaries anymore

Can only vote for the party you disagree the least with

What's right:

Stability

Society works

Global politics is also a problem. How can we influence America?

What probably won't work:

-Complaining

-Voting  indifferently

-Change inside existing parties

What might work?

-bottom up

-participation

-transparency

-open at all levels

-Fun!!!!! (Is the most radical change necessary in politics.)

A suggestion

We are going to found our own party. People that don't agree on the issues, but do agree on the process.

The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki

Groups of people can be smarter than individuals

Groups of different kinds of people together can be smarter than experts

Anybody can be a member

Program is going to be a wiki site

Physical meetings, organize meetings bottom up and get real life experts to attend

A process

Administration

Who will be involved with that decision? The people that care about it.

(Won't you get the same indifference problems that you already have. People just don't care that much.)

(Idea: figurehead elected officials that are controlled by the crowd behind it)

(Wikipediazing or WisdomOfCrowdsing politics is an interesting idea, but this guy does not lay forth any kind of vision.)

This has not been thought out in that much detail yet but we should be able to solve it.
