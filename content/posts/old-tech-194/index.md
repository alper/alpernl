I need Keynote to jump through some hoops and the [Apple online documentation](http://www.apple.com/support/keynote/) is worse than worthless. It runs through the most obvious features, but I need something different.

I have a dataset consisting of numbers and dates. Like this:

120 28 September 2006

193 2 October 2006

207 3 October 2006

222 4 October 2006

Simple integer values for each data point but you will see that the date intervals are not uniform. I need to enter these values into Keynote (or another graphing application) and have the position of the data points on the X-axis to be relative to date * (min_date / max_date).

It's not just for dates either. Whatever I put on the X-axis gets evenly spaced. Is this such a strange thing to ask? How can I best do this?
