Last Sunday we did a big haul and carried most of our stuff over to the new place in Amsterdam. Now we're almost done with the tedious process of making sure the basics are taken care of, sorting through stuff, eliminating duplicates.

My story in Delft had been finished for a while now. Loads of friends but also a lot of dead ends. Being in Amsterdam gives a fresh perspective and breathing space.

The only thing is, I don't usually mind giving up comfort, but the comfiness of [ten year's worth of accrued social contacts](http://twitter.com/alper/status/2876582221), friends, loose acquintainces, class mates, colleagues and the likes is a real loss. I hope to be able to build something similar quickly over here (and lose that again as well ((Yes, I plan to move out in a year or two.))).

So this is new beginnings in familiar places with lots of fun.
