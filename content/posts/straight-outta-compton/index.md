I would have preferred [Straight Outta Compton](http://letterboxd.com/film/straight-outta-compton/) to be a documentary cut together from real footage and narrated by the guys themselves. There is a lot of that available which you can see bits of during the credits of this movie. The biopic is well done but the dramatization does not add much and in many parts the movie devolves into melodrama.

What is amazing is how music executives are universally portrayed as the terrible human beings which they are. This is a recurring theme up until the late movie slithering appearance of Jimmy Iovine. If you read up on the stuff that went down with Ruthless you could even argue that the movie downplays it.

The record executives bring the money which in the movie is portrayed as breaking the relationships that make the music. The main characters regularly bail out of collaborations to start from zero because their contracts won't let them retain ownership of their work. Thinking about that and the outrageous claims still made by record companies made me look into the argument for copyright. It turns out that there's only [a fairly flimsy justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_copyright#Justifications_for_copyright) for a system that controls our lives.

I would like to see [12 O'Clock Boys](http://letterboxd.com/film/12-oclock-boys/) now. Fuck the police.
