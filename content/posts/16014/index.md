A wild ride of an article that draws the essential but often overlooked connections between neoliberalism and fascism.

“If “star salaries”can’t be explained by contribution to the productive enterprise, high managerial compensation would appear to be what economists call “rent”— essentially, profit extraction.”

“The most plausible explanation is that supermanagers are paid for governance where the state has been redeployed elsewhere or, even, effectively dissolved.”

“Anyone who takes seriously the threat of the newly empowered reactionary right, must take seriously the role neoliberalism has played in laying out the red carpet for its arrival.”
