Two week notes in one because last week seems to have been too busy to write any.

[![Rushing through the snow towards Amsterdam](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8233/8552432673_d375951613_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8552432673/ "Rushing through the snow towards Amsterdam by illustir, on Flickr")

Week 313 was spent in the Netherlands with a somewhat hectic visit. I spent a lot of time at the Hubbub studio and at the Open Coop.

[![Today's office](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8557842180_b73b4d0c07_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8557842180/ "Today's office by illustir, on Flickr")

And of course the inevitable five (!) visits to [the Village](http://www.thevillagecoffee.nl/) who were serving only [Coffee Collective](http://www.coffeecollective.dk/) coffees when I was there:

[![Four Coffee Collective filters, too much choice to go around. Nothing in Berlin can touch this.](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8389/8553469437_2d38f04c91_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8553469437/ "Four Coffee Collective filters, too much choice to go around.

And that Friday was [Free Bassel Day](http://freebassel.org/events/2013/03/15/free-bassel-day-event/) in remembrance of our friend who is still imprisoned in a Syrian prison:

And then it was an ICE back to Berlin already:
[![Got the sweet upgrade because NS messed up the direct connection](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8373/8561611225_333bcc71eb_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8561611225/ "Got the sweet upgrade because NS messed up the direct connection by illustir, on Flickr")

I did manage to get some good writing in those two weeks. First one piece about why levying a tax on data is not a bad idea at all: [Taxing data is not crazy](/dingen/2013/03/taxing-data-is-not-crazy/). And the week after that about Jaron Lanier who is a crazy person with some interesting ideas: [Who owns the future?](/dingen/2013/03/who-owns-the-future/)

TORREON should be about finished by now. And last Friday we also forcibly launched the [German incarnation of Politwoops](http://politwoops.de/) now with an accompanying [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/politwoopsde) because [the SPD chancellor candidate posted something](https://netzpolitik.org/2013/geloscht-tweets-von-politikern-kanzlerkandidaten-interessieren-sich-nicht-fur-netzpolitik/) he shouldn't have.

Also I'm doing another bout of programming education for non-programmers in Amsterdam next week with [a course](http://gidsy.me/OIXThB) and a [meetup](http://codeclinic.eventbrite.com/). More on that in a bit.

And I finished [my Recess! post](/dingen/2013/03/recess-7-game-gluttony/).
