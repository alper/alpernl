I'm attending the [Magnus ‘Power to the People’ seminar](http://www.magnus.nl/msite/Nieuws/Power+to+the+people+seminar+op+23+maart.htm) this Thursday in Amsterdam. The theme of this seminar fits in perfectly with my Masters project and I thought it would be good to get out and meet some new people, exchange some ideas.

I was looking around the blogosphere this afternoon to find if other people had written about it, but I could not find very much. One [post on the blog of one of the organizers](http://www.van-waveren.nl/blog/2006/02/17/power-to-the-people/), but not substantially more conversation.

[The program](http://www.magnusblogs.nl/powertothepeople/sprekers.html):

- Hans Appel from Sun; I expect him to tell some kind of vague outreach story.

- Frank Janssen; is doing a lot of pioneering work in this field on [his weblog](http://www.frankwatching.com/) and is all over the Dutch corporate Web 2.0 scene. I'm pretty curious what he has to say.

- Iwan Hullegie; marketer going to talk about viral marketing. This is probably going to be more fun than insightful.
