Paul Graham - Is it possible to create a Sillicon Valley outside of the US?

XTECH

silicon valley needs the rgiht kind of people

neeed rich people and nerds

government would ont work as invseter

start up investers have their money in it

it's the peopole not the buildings? (against technology parks)

startups don't need buildings

nerds flock together -> universities

great CS departments

bootstrap by hiring great people and then letting them attract the rest (innovatieplatform)

rich people and investers want to live there

students want to stay after they graduate (!Delft)

(he's just reading aloud one of his essays)

town with personality? not prefab

town with nerd personality, people walk around smiling (!Delft)

very negative about NY, Vegas etc. takes the nerd PoV

go to Blue counties

towns with active centers (no subursb)

Boulder + Portland

abroad?

10 Deciding Factors

1. allow immigration, SV is about immigration

2. not in poor countries

(india could rise out of it)

3. US is not yet a police state, police state also not conducive

hacking == dissent

4. decent CS universities

german and dutch try to assure all universities are equal in quality

professors need good colleagues

'controversial bit' about the lack of jews in Germany

5. you can fire people, rigid labour laws

football clubs can hire and fire people at will, nice precedent

6. work is less identified with employment

7. startups will break laws of business, startups don't have time to adhere to all laws

8. america has huge domestic market (!Netherlands)

EU was supposed to be a domestic market

different languages, but soon everybody will probalby be going to speak English

9. america has venture capital

startups beget startups but a slow cycle

private universities have VC funds

10. dynamic typing for careers

people can change more naturally

lousy public schools make you wait for college before choosing

duplicate SV but better

failings?

too far from SF

constrain the amount of land available, no sprawl

public transportation, consider cars last

lower capital gains taxes

smarter immigration policy, make a technology hub that lets in smart people (!Netherlands)

make great universities
