We had an excellent summer last year surfing on and off on Scheveningen as the waves allowed. This year has been mostly flat, but we had some waves a week ago and end of this week promises some nice swell, so surf is up.

It's nice to have a surf spot this easily accessible, but I'm curious how surfing in real waves is ((I started out on the North coast of Spain.)). So this July we'll be headed off to Aquitaine or Basque country for a week to check the waves over there.
