Yet [another discussion](http://www.joop.nl/media/detail/artikel/huffington_post_roept_amerikanen_op_hun_geld_bij_de_grote_banken_weg_te_halen/) about banks regarding [the Huffington Post call to remove your money](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/move-your-money-a-new-yea_b_406022.html) from the major American banks. There is in fact no reason why your money should be managed by a multinational public corporation (and many reasons why it shouldn't). It is partly why my banking is handled by the [Rabobank](http://www.rabobank.nl), a cooperative banking institution.

Keeping money safe is not rocket science and can be done perfectly on a local (city/province) scale with proper safeguards and insurance. Matt Mullenweg also [wrote a post](http://ma.tt/2009/08/starting-a-bank/) about how he would improve the state of banking using common (web) sense.

For the discussion I was looking for Nassim Nicholas Taleb's recommendations for not getting out of this crisis, but making sure it never happens again. I had a hard time finding them with Google, but they're in [a PDF](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/tenprinciples.pdf) on Taleb's site [Fooled by Randomness](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/).

I don't think we can read these principles often enough (at least until they are implemented by our legislators), that is why I have taken the liberty to copy out the headlines here from the PDF [^1]:

1. **What is fragile should break early while it is still small.**
1. **No socialisation of losses and privatisation of gains.**
1. **People who were driving a school bus blindfolded (and crashed it) should never be given a new bus.**
1. **Do not let someone making an “incentive”bonus manage a nuclear plant — or your financial risks.**
1. **Counter-balance complexity with simplicity.**
1. **Do not give children sticks of dynamite, even if they come with a warning.**
1. **Only Ponzi schemes should depend on confidence. Governments should never need to “restore confidence.”**
1. **Do not give an addict more drugs if he has withdrawal pains.**
1. **Citizens should not depend on financial assets or fallible “expert”advice for their retirement.**
1. **Make an omelette with the broken eggs.**

These are only the headlines. Be sure to read [the full recommendations in the PDF](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/tenprinciples.pdf).
