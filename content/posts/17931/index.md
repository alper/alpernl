I think Facebook rolled back their block of Pixelfed but they're right to be spooked. Showing a bunch of pictures in a stream hardly seems like a technological challenge. And what are all the people working at Instagram doing other than figuring out novel ways to track you and serve you ads?

You should definitely try out Pixelfed which is more than usable.
