This summer I shot a roll of color film I had lying around using my trusty [Yashica D](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/5639627465/) medium-format camera. The subjects were passers-by in our Amsterdam office. The results were better than expected.

Ties shines on this classic laptop shot (the stickers do add a nice touch): [![Ties Alfrink](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6092/6288979790_8cb9c6471a.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/6288979790/ "Ties Alfrink by illustir, on Flickr")

Martijn in a similar stance has a razor sharp glance (and curls): [![Martijn Pannevis](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6213/6288459791_ca9d0ce1b1.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/6288459791/ "Martijn Pannevis by illustir, on Flickr")

James's essence is captured quite nicely in this picture: [![James Burke](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6111/6288459497_c32e0f152f.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/6288459497/ "James Burke by illustir, on Flickr")

Peter came out a bit under-exposed but turned out nicely with some brushing up (and burning): [![Peter Robinett](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6108/6288460151_02a8ded193.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/6288460151/ "Peter Robinett by illustir, on Flickr")

The tallest of former coworkers Tim comes out nicely too: [![Tim van den Dool](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6112/6288460685_ff9872a0da.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/6288460685/ "Tim van den Dool by illustir, on Flickr")

All in all, that is five usable frames from twelve shot which is a more than decent score. It looks like I should shoot more portraits. Any volunteers?
