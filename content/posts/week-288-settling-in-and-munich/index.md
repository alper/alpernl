Monday I was given a Clever coffee maker and a Hario grinder to be able to make slow coffees at the office. Thanks [Kars](http://twitter.com/kaeru) and [Lea](http://twitter.com/fraulea) for being so attentive. I also made a start moving my books over but more and more having a professional ((I already immolated my personal library several moves ago.)) physical library is feeling like a huge dead weight.

I would like to have these books in digital form but I'm sure as hell not going to pay for them all again at ebook markups. No way in hell. Bittorrent seems like a better option.

We're very proud of Beestende being a game that actually does what it promises and we submitted it to [the Dutch Game Awards](http://www.dutchgameawards.nl/2012/beestenbende/).

A trailer for a reality show that I participated in about a year ago was released under the title [Heetsel](http://www.persuader.nl/heetsel/). Doing anything for tv or tv-like media feels intensely surreal and judging from the final edit that surreality is conveyed quite well by the delivered product.

I [published the video and brief write-up](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2012/09/love-in-times-of-gamification-at-next-berlin/) of my [NEXT Berlin](http://nextberlin.eu/) talk about love and gamification over at Hubbub.

On Wednesday I did random administrative stuff and prepped my visit to Munich the next day.

On Friday I had coffee with [Chris Eidhof](http://chris.eidhof.nl/) at [the new Barn](http://www.thebarn.de/) which is a stunning large venue with a roaster and a very large coffee desk. The coffee is the same quality we're used to but [it's policies](https://twitter.com/THEBARNBERLIN/status/248785718300794880) are a bit more restrictive. I won't talk about the online tumult caused by this, but I hope they can sort it out quickly and then focus again on what they do best: brewing awesome coffee.

And finally I had a cup with [Mustafa](https://twitter.com/codesurgeon) at the [Five Elephant](http://www.fiveelephant.com/). Mustafa is an all-star programmer who has recently moved to Berlin to build a startup. Another too little publicized —soon to be— success story in the local scene.
