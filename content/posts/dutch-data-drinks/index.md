There's a lot of stuff happening in the Dutch Data Scene and more communication and consolidation of efforts is in order.

Quoting from [the Facebook event](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=160152187333385) ( [Plancast](http://plancast.com/p/2b0c)) I created:

> Open drinks for the Dutch Open Data / Dataviz Community next to PICNIC ( http://www.picnicnetwork.org/ ) both for conference attendees and those that want to attend but can't.
>
> There are more and more people busy with data in the Netherlands, but most of the efforts are widely disparate. PICNIC seems like a good focal point for various efforts to come together.
>
> This is an informal Friday afternoon drink meant to get everybody together and talking about data. Topics include: open data, government information, data visualization, cartography, statistics, data mining, journalism and pretty much anything generating, processing or consuming data.

This will probably be the first of a recurring event. I know a ton of people in various domains very busy with data and it will be to the benefit of us all if we talk to one another. Don't worry if you can't make it to this one. There will be more.

Event details:
**Friday, September 24 Â· 6:00pm - 8:00pm**
**Location: het Ketelhuis**
Pazzanistraat 25-29
Amsterdam, Netherlands
