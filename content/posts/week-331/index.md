With KANT we were still figuring out mostly what it is we are doing and seeing as we are neither a collective or a coworking space it was up in the air a bit. I [wrote up our offering](http://kantberlin.com/offering) in a more straight-forward and streamlined way where you can very easily find what it is you may be looking for. In other news we are discussing next steps for KANT in the future but anything on that order is off for at least 6-12 months.

That week I attended the Cocoaheads meetup on the Luftgarten at Tempelhofer Airport. This week the plans for the city to build at least two thirds of that field have been revealed. The [100% Tempelhofer Feld initiative](http://www.thf100.de/mitmachen.html) is already preparing their campaign in September and it looks like it's going to be a long winter. The reasoning of policy makers is 'How can Berlin afford not to build on this piece of land?’ which is a staggeringly stupid way to frame something if ever I heard it.

I got my Canon S100 camera which is proving to be a lot of fun and is getting me photographing at volume again. Judging from the pictures and the f/2.0 lens it has about the same performance as my old EOS camera with its kit lens but now in a much smaller package. What is also interesting is how accustomed people have gotten to larger cameras and phones that a small pocket cam hardly registers anymore.

I also did some experiments with video mounting the camera on my bike:

I could not bother installing [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) again (and definitely not with the Creative Cloud hell) and setting up any kind of workflow, so my current editing philosophy is NONE. Pictures are nominally straightened in iPhoto and slapped straight to Flickr.

Our Friday Sheperditchi breakfasts are getting more and more fun with random friends dropping in. If you're reading this, we usually have breakfast with KANT at [Simitdchi](https://foursquare.com/v/simitdchi/4c19cd8dfe5a76b00c300415) on Friday mornings at 09:00 to get an early start into the day.

And also with the summer lots of people are blowing through Berlin among which Peter Rukavina:

And just to close off with a whole grilled fish:
