A while back we went to the [World Press Photo](http://www.worldpressphoto.org/) 2008 exhibition in Utrecht [with some capoeiras](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/sets/72157606141100891/) and looked at the pictures many of us had already seen after the first announcement.

I had prepared a bit for the day by listening to [the photographers' commentaries on their pictures](http://www.worldpressphoto.org/images/stories/videos/Interviews/index.php). As is the case with many artists, the artist should not try to explain his art but in some cases the commentary really adds a lot to the picture.

I would recommend Platon about his portrait of Poetin, John Moore about the Bhutto assassination and Brent Stirton about the preservation of gorillas.
