Elias has [an important post](http://torrez.us/archives/2006/05/08/439/) on something very necessary: enabling client side Javascript developers to consume any kind of RESTific data without going through the pains of cross-platform XML parsing.

Some time back I have been a victim of the XML thing and since then I would like my data in Javascript either with JSON or with a data binding client library like the one for XML-RPC.

> […] we can explain our thinking by sort of saying that we avoid parsing XML like the plague.

Amen.
