The first week after the holiday and therefore somewhat slow. Some work on Code 4, [Choke Point Project](http://chokepointproject.net/) and our own internal game project _guadalupe_.

It was fun to help our friends from [Hubbub move into their new offices](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2011/08/we%E2%80%99ve-moved-again/). A bit bare at first, but shaping up nicely.
