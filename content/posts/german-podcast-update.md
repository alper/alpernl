I'm swapping out [Lage der Nation](https://www.kuechenstud.io/lagedernation/) whose popularity has led them to lose focus and believe in their own hype for [FAZ Einspruch](https://blogs.faz.net/einspruch/).

Einspruch is solely focused on legal issues which is what I listened to Lage mostly anyway. In Lage I had to skip the regurgitation of international issues for a German audience (much better covered elsewhere), the explanation of very basic facts (like where Venezuela is located) and the incessant mansplaining. After a while not that much was left.
