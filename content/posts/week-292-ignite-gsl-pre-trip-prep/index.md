I'm sitting here at [Beijing Airport](http://en.bcia.com.cn/) writing these too late weeknotes on their free WiFi [^1] which is an oddly implemented but still excellent service.

Last week was mostly spent with a [scattered brain](/dingen/2012/10/games-on-ignite-berlin-3/#footnote_0_3965) working on my ignite an various proposals. We had a studio meeting at [Praxis](http://praxisberlin.net/) to discuss recent developments and issues.

Thursday night [I gave the Ignite](/dingen/2012/10/games-on-ignite-berlin-3/) to a packed Supermarkt Berlin. Thanks everybody for attending and listen to me rave about games for five minutes. Also fantastic to meet everybody in Berlin who I hadn't caught up with for ages.

On Friday I finished off most of my paperwork before the trip. That night we went to [see Werner Herzog read](/dingen/2012/10/conquest-of-the-useless/) with the studio.

The next morning I got up at seven to see the market build up and watch [the GSL Code S final](http://www.gomtv.net/2012gsls4/vod/) together with [Mustafa Işık](http://twitter.com/codesurgeon) and a colleague of his. You are either mildly serious about watching this or you are not. I'd already set up and tested the [GOM Player](http://www.gomlab.com/eng/) before. That's the bit of KPop you see above.

It was rather exhilarating to see a GSL event streamed live and I'm glad my light season ticket entitled me to view it. I've recently gotten into Star Craft because of Frank Lantz's excellent [“Drinking Man's Guide to Watching Star Craft”](http://www.edge-online.com/features/drinking-mans-guide-watching-starcraft-race-wars/) and am greatly enjoying it as a highly complex, dense and therefore less boring alternative to most spectator sports.
