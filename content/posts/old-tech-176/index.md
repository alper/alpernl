This [video of Seth Godin](http://www.van-waveren.nl/blog/2006/08/09/seth-godin-video/) is well worth your time. The man has a funny story and he is a great presenter with fantastic presence.

For reference, the reasons stuff is broken are:

- Not my job
- Selfish jerks
- The world changed
- I didn't know
- I'm not a fish
- Contradictions
- Broken on purpose
