Using the same Github account for work that you also use to do anything and everything else with is not particularly secure. That's why I split my presence on the platform, but getting everything to work that way has been somewhat annoying.

I found this guide by Rahul Pandey that's been a huge help in how to take a lot of the pain out of it.
