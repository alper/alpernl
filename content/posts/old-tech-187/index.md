Flickr and Delicious have lately been integrating pieces of each other, what with them having the same parent company and all.

Del.icio.us integrates the square thumbnail photographs from Flickr if you save them. This is something any service could do using the [Flickr API](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/) but it probably makes more sense to them.

Flickr sports ‘Save to del.icio.us’ buttons on their photo pages. A lot of webpages do that nowadays but it makes extra sense for them to do it (as with the Upcoming integration).

A blatant usability lack in the integration is that when you save a Flickr photograph to delicious it does not take into account the photograph's tags. It should copy them directly or put them in the recommended tags so as not to bother me with thinking them up and typing them in again.

Flickr and delicious are both tag based services, this would make sense right?
