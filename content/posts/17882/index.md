> \[…\] the Rands Leadership Slack is the most impactful thing I’ve built outside my family and job.

I can testify to the Rands Leadership Slack being an impactful thing. I've joined it a long time ago and more or less everything I know about engineering leadership I've learned there. I'm eternally grateful for all the hard work the people there put into making that a nice place to be.
