Lang [verhaal by the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/magazine/23google.html?ei=5088&en=9721027e105631bf&ex=1303444800&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=all) over de (soms problematische) entree van Google in China. Aardig wat inzichten verborgen tussen heel veel claims. De meeste Chinezes schijnen erg lakoniek te zijn over de maatregelen van *hun* overheid.

Een stukje:

> "Google has struck a compromise," he said, and compromises are sometimes necessary. Yahoo's behavior, he added, put it in a different category: "Yahoo is a sellout. Chinese people hate Yahoo." The difference, Zhao said, was that Yahoo had put individual dissidents in serious danger and done so apparently without thinking much about the human damage. (Yahoo did not respond to requests for comment.) Google, by contrast, had avoided introducing any service that could get someone jailed. It was censoring information, but Zhao considered that a sin of omission, rather than of commission.
