WiFi connectivity at the [XTECH conference](htttp://xtech.org) here in Krasnapolsky is very poor. They have bought a conference wide login for everyone on the commercial network already in place and it is not cutting it.

These commercial networks cost a lot of money and you would expect it to have an accompanying high amount of bandwidth and availability. Apparently this is not the case if a couple of hundred laptop-toting people get together.

Getting online is a challenge and if you do manage to the bandwidth available is meager.

It's not that big a problem for us conference-goers that we can't check our e-mail and stuff but it's more of a hassle for speakers who can't do their demoes live while speaking.
