I had previously posted about a deep dive of the connections of the anthroposophical movement with fascism.

What's also quite poignant are the fascist foundations of the ecological movement in Germany. It's not just fascist but in the weird post-war political space here every type of idiocy is pretty much represented.

Petra Kelly is essential to understand why the Greens are so so opposed to nuclear energy. She got together with an officer of the German army who was used by the Stasi (as part of [the Generals for Peace](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generale_für_den_Frieden)) to argue for disarmament. He eventually shot her and himself to death.

It's a good example of how anything peace movement related here was a ploy by the Russians not to get their ass kicked (and still is).

And here's a historical treatment of all the ecofascist tendencies that tried to be part of the ecological movement in post-nazi Germany. Some of them got disillusioned and rebuked by the party's tendency towards eco-socialism, but others managed to latch on.

The absurd cast of characters in both of these stories are a clear testament for how pretty much everybody in German society after the war was damaged goods.
