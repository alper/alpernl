The o3 AGI result looked so noteworthy that I dove into it. I [read one of the papers](/dingen/2024/12/17805/) that's at the base of the approach and thought it was pretty interesting.

Turns out that it was mostly bullshit and everybody was doing another round of "let's pretend that AGI is real". What a shambles.
