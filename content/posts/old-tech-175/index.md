[Rob Enderle](http://news.digitaltrends.com/talkback137.html) reads a lot into the WWDC Keynote slams Steve Jobs made on both Microsoft and Dell.

He does have a more valid point than he thinks with regards to the weaning users off of their Windows habit. I know a lot of people who bought Apple laptops or minis as an addition to the pcs they already had. They thought they would continue working as normal and use the Mac for some small time stuff.

In most of these cases their original pcs stayed all but untouched while their owners became completely hooked on the Apple platform.

Having the option of running Windows on your Mac will provide a necessary mental security for users hesitant to switch away from something they have a lifelong dependency on. In reality they will not use Windows anymore except for games and some specialty software.
