Last week was a week in Amsterdam (and what a week it was!).

Monday I was in the train, which seems to take shorter and shorter because of the worklfow achieved there. I dropped in straight to the Open Coop to push the stuff I had created online (among which [a professional summary of 2011](/dingen/2012/01/work-in-2011/)) and then went off to the Mediamatic Schommelclub where I saw most of the regulars and a great performance:

Tuesday I hung out with my friends from the Village before heading to Hubbub central for a bit of [metagaming](http://metaga.me) ((I want a metagame deck, but the shipping is so steep!)) ( [arguing pro](http://instagr.am/p/f9-lM/)) and the kickoff for project saba. I also [blogged about our Berlin plans](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2012/01/starting-up-in-berlin/) on Hubbub and installed [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) on my laptop for some heavy duty game development.

The project is going to be great if only judging from the concept art that was produced during that afternoon.

Wednesday was filled wit back to back meetings with [Justus Bruns](http://justusbruns.com/), hanging out at the awesome [Brainsley](http://brainsley.com/) offices, having lunch with lovely [Tim de Gier](http://timdegier.nl/), talking game design shop with [Christine Fountain](http://iloveyoutool.com/) and then having dinner and going to a play with [Oliver Verver](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/oliververver).

Thursday I spent cooped up at the Open Coop all day working on various Open State stuff and then it was off to the annual ISOC Chairperson's Dinner and New Year's Drinks. I discussed the option to change your date of birth with some of the more privacy minded attendees and that sparked [this pos](/dingen/2012/01/regain-your-privacy/) t.

And Friday it was a brief bit at the Coop to pack up my office and then jump on the train back to Berlin. I am now also a part of the [Iron Blogger Berlin network](http://ironbloggerberlin.com/participants/) to insure blog frequency.
