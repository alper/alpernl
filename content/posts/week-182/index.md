The belated weeknotes for the last week. My apologies. Another inbetween week, with a ton of events.

Monday was [Mobile Monday](http://www.mobilemonday.nl/category/events/17/) on design with great performances by Arnall and Webb. Good to see our Dutch friends exposed to real design (i.e. _not_ solving problems). Let's hope interesting and valuable stuff comes from it.

Tuesday I read into a bunch of arcane protocol stuff for [Urbanode](http://twitter.com/urbanode) and went to a lecture by landscape architect Ronald Rietveld ( [my notes](/dingen/2010/09/ronald-rietveld-arcam-lecture/)).

Wednesday I got to talk with some of the chief [creative minds](http://www.buropony.nl/) in the Southern Randstad. Expect some awesome visuals headed this way sometime soonish.

Thursday marked another bunch of wrap-up and attendance of the UX Cocktail Hours (which were hosted by [SapientNitro](http://www.sapient.com/en-us/sapientnitro.html) and quite ace).

(Friday was occupied with more of the above.)
