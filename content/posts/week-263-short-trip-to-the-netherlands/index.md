Last week commenced with preparing my presentation for [the CrossLab event in Rotterdam](http://extra.wdka.nl/crosslab/2012/03/14/crosslab-event-dynamic-design/). On Tuesday I took the train from Berlin and got there nicely in time.

The face of Rotterdam is changing massively and visibly right now with the construction of a new central station that is going to be architecturally impressive:

Glad to see so many friends out for the event it was great to present a new aesthetic, algorithmic design (& peril) presentation to the audience of Rotterdam designers.

Wednesday it was off to meet a client in the Bijlmer and then a workday at the Coop.

Thursday I called at Utrecht among other things to celebrate the first anniversary of [The Village Coffee and Music](http://thevillagecoffee.nl/). Their continued presence makes working in Utrecht more than bearable.

The other pleasure is hanging out all day at Hubbub base where a lot of things are on the burner waiting to get shipped.

I got to play Hokra at Tweetakt which is one of the social games that are programmed there. The other Joust is pictured below and got a lot of play time:
