I'm incredibly proud of the team and events coming together in our organization of the biggest [Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl) feature yet. Looking back on the past year, it has been an incredible ride with the various _Apps for…_ competitions and no small amount of personal and professional changes.

At the end of this month, on Saturday the 26th, we'll be holding a Hack de Overheid event like you're used to with some notable additions that are going to blow everybody's mind. The event is called [**Code Camping Amsterdam**](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/2011/10/code-camping-amsterdam/), it is part of the [Apps voor Nederland](http://www.appsvoornederland.nl/) program in collaboration with [Waag Society](http://waag.org/) and you can register on the bottom of the page.

We'll be having three internationally renowned speakers whose work alone speaks for itself, let alone their presence on our event. [Marietje Schaake](http://twitter.com/marietjed66) is our most favourable representation in the European Parliament but as far as I know a politician of her stature has never before spoke in front of an audience of Makers in the Netherlands before. [Marius Watz](http://mariuswatz.com/)'s visual art inspires awe and wonder and I have used his software on several occasions in my work for [Monster Swell](http://monsterswell.com/). [Matt Biddulph](http://www.hackdiary.com/)'s work and shipped products have been used by most of the people I know and inspired me and I think many more programmers to build more and better.

The location in the derelict Toren Overhoeks ((Formerly known as the Shell Tower as it was the location from which Shell's infamous post-colonial regime was directed from.)) is a culmination both of convenience and inconvenience. Just across the central train station, but without any facilities left in the building ((Those were all torn out by Shell when they left. Such pleasant people…)) it exemplifies a once and future state of our cities. Remnants of an age gone by where hackers gather with makeshift facilities to create something better.

After the event there is going to be a party by the [Eddie the Eagle Museum](http://eddietheeaglemuseum.com/) a formation famous in their own right for holding the most out there awesome parties in the city ((And I'm not exaggerating when I say that. Their work is legendary.)). It is a privilege working together with people this competent when it comes to fun and so creative when it comes to convention. See [their party description](http://www.aukjedekker.nl/eddie/):

> The future has found us! And its leader is a code. Our digitally hypnotised desire has led to a world without mistakes, governed by spyware and malware. Humanity is an experiment proved inferior. Let’s crack the code to correct it. Enter the Hackathon and exuberantly celebrate a world without errors! With high, low and no-tech, we are the new Trojan Horses marching in, ritually erasing the failings of the past. Let’s roughly and frantic lose our last human bit with a codefest in the Tower of the Shell.

Finally as I have hinted before, the currency for application contests is diminishing along with the consolidation of the open data platforms and the publication of more and more datasets. If after [Apps voor Nederland](http://www.appsvoornederland.nl/) is over, you follow-up with another cookie-cutter competition, that would be missing the point. That also means that this competition is the best moment to get your datasets out and get attention for them in the ecosystem as it is right now. What will be next? We have some ideas, but we don't know anything for sure yet. The only thing that is certain: you'd better be there next Saturday!
