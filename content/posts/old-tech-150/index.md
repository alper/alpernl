I sympathize with [Mark Hammond's decision](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks). Apple is the lesser evil of non-free software. In the light of Apple's stubbornness and lack of transparency my bough creaks from time to time but it is holding strong for now.

I'm still hoping for a good and free alternative and if I see the progress that is being made on that front —as opposed to the complete lack of progress on the Vista front— that hope may well be justified. Until that is a reality, I can hold out a bit longer.
