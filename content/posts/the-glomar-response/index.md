A couple of weeks ago already, James Bridle opened his first solo show [The Glomar Response](http://www.nomeproject.com/exhibitions/glomar-response) at NOME gallery here in Berlin. The opening was attended by more or less everybody I got to know when I first got to Berlin, a reunion of sorts.

The exhibition is a collection of recent work and is still exhibited there for this entire month. James is one of the few artists who creates thoughtful work from the conflation of state power and information technology. His work is only made stronger by the writing that underpins it which is all worth reading and [listed neatly over on booktwo](http://booktwo.org/).
