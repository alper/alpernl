Ribbonfarm retiring is another such ending in a time rife with them. I can't overstate how influential it has been on my (our) thinking and practice. Tremendously impressive to think all of that was thought up by one person (who I still haven't met).

It'd be impossible to summarise all the themes, intersections and other tidbits that [I got out of Ribbonfarm](/dingen/?s=ribbonfarm). I can say how it begun: I was lying on the river-shore in Avignon in 2012 and I had a large part of the blog's back catalog in my Instapaper and there I read the entire thing while listening to the crickets.
