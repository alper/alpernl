I rewatched [Once Upon a Time in Anatolia](http://letterboxd.com/film/once-upon-a-time-in-anatolia/) last week with my parents and it was even better than the first time. I usually think that movies shouldn't be longer than two hours but here even a second viewing did not bore.

What I learned is that it at one point the convoy moves out of the [Kırıkkale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%B1r%C4%B1kkale) area into the administrative part of Turkey that we are from ( [map](https://goo.gl/maps/k3RXz)).

The idle chit-chat of the people in the cars is still funny but now it was easier to keep track of the interleaving stories. Pared down they rend flesh. Arap's story about why you need a gun or the piecewise telling of a woman's suicide are incredible. The point where Clark Gable swallows his words being one extreme example.

My memory had exaggerated the appearance of the angel halfway through the movie. It is still a key moment but not as magically-realistic as I had remembered.

The movie as a whole is about the utter insignificance of human action on all levels. Or as the poet ((I am [told](http://www.eksiduyuru.com/duyuru/354018/bir-zamanlar-anadolu-da-doktorun-okudugu-siir) that the poet is [Mikhail Lermontov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Lermontov) but I haven't been able to find an English version of the poem.)) said: ‘years again will pass and I will leave no trace // darkness and cold will encompass my weary soul’.

I am immensely looking forward to seeing his next movie [Kış Uykusu](http://letterboxd.com/film/winter-sleep/) which is playing in cinemas right now. And I am still eagerly awaiting Nuri Bilge Ceylan to make a movie adaptation of one of Pamuk's big books ( [The Black Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11692.The_Black_Book?from_search=true) or [Snow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11691.Snow?from_search=true)).
