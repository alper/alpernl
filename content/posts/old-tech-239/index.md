After the [random](http://alper.nl/blog/tech/196) [shutdown](http://alper.nl/blog/tech/202) episodes of the past my Macbook now has entered the more sophisticated era of nonrandom shutdowns.

Normal Mac laptops will go to sleep when their battery is nearly empty. Mine however simply shuts down. This happens usually when the indicator says it still has 10-15 minutes of battery life left.

A [similar](http://forums.macnn.com/69/powerbook-and-macbook-pro/292000/macbook-pro-premature-shut-down/) [problem](http://forums.macnn.com/69/powerbook-and-macbook-pro/296833/mbp-battery-empty-before-warnng-forced/) has been reported with Macbook Pros but not with Macbooks yet.

Quite annoying to lose your work if you forget (or are unable to) plug in. [LJS](http://www.ljs.nl) didn't have a clue last time I was there. I think I'll pay them a repeat visit and insist they do something about it.
