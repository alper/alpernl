It's super lovely that Berlin has a lab which does these kind of user tested innovations on city processes. The work that needs to be done is written up here and it's relatively straight-forward (there are just no short-cuts).

What we need with the Bürgeramt though is not 10% more appointments but the automation of at least half of the processes there to no longer need human intervention. We needed that 10 years ago.
