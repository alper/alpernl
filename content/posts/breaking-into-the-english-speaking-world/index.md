Last week we finally got featured with Bycatch on [Boingboing](http://boingboing.net/2015/08/20/bycatch-card-game.html) and [Fast Company](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3050202/simulate-the-fatal-fallibility-of-drone-strikeswith-a-fun-card-game) thanks to our invitation to the XOXO festival. It is amazing to see what that attention does and what kind of effect that has on sales.

Now that we have finally arrived in the English speaking world we can relax a bit and keep pushing out the marketing we had planned all along. I would be curious to see whether something similar happens at some point for Japanese and Chinese speaking online communities.
