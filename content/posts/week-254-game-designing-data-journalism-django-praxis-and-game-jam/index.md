Last week started with recuperating from the second massive move we did getting massive wood furniture from Saxony. That was spent with a long overdue first visit to [the Barn](http://thebarn.de/) here.

The next day I peeked in a bit with the game design process at Hubbub.

Then I went to the Django meetup in Berlin organized by [Jannis Leidel](http://twitter.com/jezdez) over at [The Maker's Loft](http://web.stagram.com/location/5791276).

I was also pleased with [this write-up by Kevin Slavin of the](http://slavin.tumblr.com/post/16402873777/social-cities-of-tomorrow-conference-text-by-michiel) [Social Cities of Tomorrow](http://www.socialcitiesoftomorrow.nl/) conference over on his Tumblr (which is pure gold by the way).

> The event Social Cities of Tomorrow is also intended as an alternative to the increasingly popular idea of ‘smart’ or ‘intelligent’ cities.

It is good to see our friends from [the Mobile City](http://www.themobilecity.nl/) to be so well attuned with the international cutting edge when it comes to smart city rhetoric.

Wednesday I visited the [Daten & Journalisten](http://ddjberlin.tumblr.com/) meetup at the [taz](http://taz.de) headquarters here in Berlin and I presented some of the data journalism projects we did both with [Hack de Overheid](http://hackdeoverheid.nl) and with [Monster Swell](http://monsterswell.com).

On Thursday I dropped by Praxis, the office of [Rainer Kohlberger](http://kohlberger.net/) and worked there for a bit. That day also marked the awards ceremony for the [Apps voor Nederland](http://www.appsvoornederland.nl/) contest and the success allowed us to get our minister of economic affairs to [side with open data on television](http://nos.nl/op3/video/334610-minister-verhagen-over-open-data.html).

On Friday I was off to Friedrichshain to receive my team for the [gamejam](http://globalgamejam.org/) and that ended the week. Results of the gamejam are in [this event write-up](/dingen/2012/02/early-2012-events/).
