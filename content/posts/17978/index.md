An roller coaster of an interview with a series of FizzBuzz extensions that are honestly not even that bad, but poor form from the interviewers' side not to recognize the absolute balling brilliance on display here.

I can just about follow along with this level of Typescript type level programming but to be able to whip this out during an interview is a testament of mastery.
