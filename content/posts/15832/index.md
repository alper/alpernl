> “75 jaar vrijheid, en wat krijg je? De lichtgevende lul van Daan Roosegaarde.”

[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/11/02/als-twee-mensen-hetzelfde-doen-a3978941](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/11/02/als-twee-mensen-hetzelfde-doen-a3978941)

Not very fair but overdue for somebody who's bought into his own hype and believes (as do most Dutch creatives) that all of their ideas are original.

I checked the concept and the video and it is indeed very reminiscent of the Stolpersteine without a mention and the presentation is as flat as we're used to from Roosegaarde.
