Catching the [widget fever](http://alper.nl/blog/tech/117) in a bad way last night's [Colbert Report](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/index.jhtml) episode inspired Reinier and me to create a widget based on the [Backwards Bush](http://www.backwardsbush.com/) counter.

![Finished Widget](http://static.flickr.com/47/136141103_4fcad14863_m.jpg)[](http://alper.nl/ajax/widgets/DaysOfDubya.wdgt.zip)

The Backwards Bush site does offer [a Dashboard widget](http://www.backwardsbush.com/screensaver.php) but it is utter crap. We knew we could do better than that. So we grabbed the still from the Report and inspired by the [“Do It!”](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/doit.html) it also leaves you with a happy message.

Get it here: [Days of Dubya Dashboard Widget](http://alper.nl/ajax/widgets/DaysOfDubya.wdgt.zip)

or if my server can't handle it anymore, [get it from Reinier](http://www.zwitserloot.com/2006/04/28/daysofdubya-the-widget/).

And if you like this widget [digg it](http://digg.com/apple/Days_of_Dubya_Dashboard_Widget).
