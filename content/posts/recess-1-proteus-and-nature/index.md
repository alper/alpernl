_Recess! is a correspondence series with personal ruminations on games._ [![proteus2](proteus2.jpg)](/dingen/2013/02/recess-1-proteus-and-nature/proteus2/)

Dear [Kars](http://leapfrog.nl/) and [Niels](http://nielsthooft.com/),

I finally bought [Proteus](http://www.visitproteus.com/) yesterday and though I really wanted to like it, I only half succeeded. It truly is a beautiful looking game but I do care a great deal about goals in the games I play (otherwise I probably would have loved [Glitch](http://www.glitch.com/) too). Proteus has even fewer goals than [Dear Esther](http://dear-esther.com/). I can chase a few animals but other than that there isn't much else to do on the island than to look at the spectacular sunsets.

My issue with that is that I think I should go outside and experience real nature instead of a procedurally generated facsimile on my screen, however beautiful it may be. Am I being a stick in the mud? The [Kleistpark](http://goo.gl/maps/2Jcqt) around the corner here is rather plain but this afternoon I did spot a fat bird between the branches.

Last week I was looking for a quick game to unwind in between work. [Luftrausers](http://www.vlambeer.com/tag/luftrausers/) would fit the bill, but that isn't available yet on my system. I'm more or less done with [Hundreds](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hundreds/id493536432?mt=8) by now. I am playing [Galcon](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/galcon-lite/id290775344?mt=8) now on the iPhone and sort of enjoying that. So my first Recess stays at the surface and is about that age old: tell me what to play.
