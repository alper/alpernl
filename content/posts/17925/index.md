For those who want to introduce some whimsy into their programming and for whom using a variable width font in your code editor is a bit too far, there is now Comic Mono ( [via](https://www.iamcal.com/2025-01/)). It doesn't even look all too terrible.

(After using Iosevka and Inconsolata for a long time, I'm now as are many people a happy Jetbrains Mono user.)
