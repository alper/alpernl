Maybe after this New Yorker exposé, Joi Ito will finally resign?

[https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-an-elite-university-research-center-concealed-its-relationship-with-jeffrey-epstein](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-an-elite-university-research-center-concealed-its-relationship-with-jeffrey-epstein?fbclid=IwAR3NWrrH44dlelFCZKHbbK0Va5mDd9uSFpzRZXPEP4bKSbX6YdHA45vq9hk)

Full disclosure: Joi Ito once paid for my lunch in a café in Beirut when I was traveling there with some tech people.

My exposure to the inner machinations of Ito's clique didn't leave me too enthusiastic. It also became clear that underneath the glamorous surface there was very little of interest or value.

I'm glad the only thing he paid for me was a lunch otherwise I would also be rather embarrassed right now.

**Update:** [He just did.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/business/mit-media-lab-jeffrey-epstein-joichi-ito.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&fbclid=IwAR1JHxzmq3aFDwsOaF_qhiXmHIRUwsTPX33-UiVGw-3jAICqp0H9jCJt77w) But judging from [comments by Negroponte](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614264/mit-media-lab-jeffrey-epstein-joi-ito-nicholas-negroponte-funding-sex-abuse/amp/?__twitter_impression=true), “Nicholas Negroponte, a founder of the lab, said he had told Mr. Ito to take the money and would do it again.”, there is more wrong with the institution than just the one person.
