[Nat writes](http://nat.org/2005/november/#OpenOffice-startup-time) about a speedup of OOo startup times. So this means that it starts up in half a century?

On the Mac we do not get real versions of Open Office, though they have been promised. On the [site you can choose](http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/ooo-osx_downloads.html) between an Advanced 2.0 build or a NeoOffice/J version.

The advanced 2.0 version still uses Xwindows which probably is not good. I think I tried this but did not get it to work. I now have the NeoOffice version but I cringe everytime I have to start it. It takes ages and ages before it opens a simple spreadsheet and operation is unbearably slow.

This is a bit of a shame. I do get a free license for MS Office from the university maybe I should use that.
