It seems like Apple is in a confused place. Maybe an intrinsic part of the creative process, but being more thoughtful about the real world should not hurt them too much.

The French courts [have upheld](http://www.physorg.com/news11896.html) a judgement by [Steve Jobs in 2002](http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/cultofmac/index.blog?entry_id=1443172) where he ruled that:

> “If you legally acquire music, you need to have the right to manage it on all other devices that you own.”

And they have rightfully not heeded Apple's (and ergo Jobs's) confused state.

[Closed formats and DRM are bad](http://www.craphound.com/msftdrm.txt).

We want to be able to play our stuff whenever wherever. More support for this closed source anti-competititve stance has come from free market advocates extraordinaire: [the Cato Institute](http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/03/22#bravoCato). Quoting from the quote:

> “Rather, progress is promoted in a technological marketplace of interoperable products, consumer choice, and fierce competition.”

And closing off: [Apple firing an employee of theirs](http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/19/apple-employee-gets-fired-for-hilarious-standup-poetry-routine/) for the only talented performance at a talent show, is so sectarian that it scares the shit out of me.
