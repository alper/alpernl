Since the one digital thing that Germany is really good at is copying, here is the UK's 2025 roadmap for digital and data. Just copy-paste it and do everything that's in there.

- Exceed public expectations
- Equip civil servants for a digital future
- Enhance government efficiency and security

Anything less than that is not really acceptable anymore.
