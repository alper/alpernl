Haven't got mine yet, but yes they're [Magic Tables](http://berglondon.com/blog/2010/06/17/magic-tables-not-magic-windows/).

During the run up to the iPad launch most pundits got into a pissing match of naysaying and detracting from the device. “It's just a bigger iPhone.”Most of which has by now been disproved.

Like BERG say, it's a consumer ready, performant, portable version of the [Microsoft Surface](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/default.aspx). If you have ever played with a Surface, you know that it's a horribly bad and slow experience AND it has a €10k price tag attached. The iPad is a Surface that works for a very broad definition of _‘works’_.

Microsoft can go back to the drawing board. Apple ate their lunch.
