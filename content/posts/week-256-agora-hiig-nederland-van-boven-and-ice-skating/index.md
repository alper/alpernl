Last week was cut a bit short by a commute to Amsterdam at the end (touching on that in a bit).

Monday I settled in at the Agora Collective for the week to work from there. I mentioned before that I really needed a fixed studio space to work from. I wasn't really aiming for a coworking space, but Agora is a great place to be at.

I spent more of the week in XCode and playing around various iPhone development ins and outs.

Wednesday I viewed an office at [Kottbusser Tor](http://g.co/maps/3yg3b) and then made my way to the HIIG for a [discussion on how the internet changes democracy](http://hiig.de/2012/02/10/%C2%BBberliner-gespr%C3%A4che%C2%AB-zu-internet-und-gesellschaft/) (about which I wrote [‘A deeper simulation fever’](/dingen/2012/02/a-deeper-simulation-fever-at-the-berliner-gesprache/)).

Thursday I had to go to the Netherlands early to attend the closing event for [‘Nederland van Boven’](http://nederlandvanboven.vpro.nl/) a [VPRO](http://www.vpro.nl/) series featuring aerial videography and data visualizations. The production team spent a lot of time getting at data to be able to show it on television. I was invited to debate for the cause of open data alongside [Alexander Klöpping](http://www.alexanderklopping.nl/) against the sceptic positions of Marleen Stikker and Arco Groothedde.

On my visit I briefly dropped by the Open Coop and on Friday morning I skated a bit across the canals of Amsterdam before jumping into the train back to Berlin again.
