As [per Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/08/12/my-year-in-cities-2008) fished out of my iCal and [my Dopplr](http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/alper/public), [hat tip Mark](http://novemberborn.net/life/year-in-cities-2008):

- Berlin*
- Amsterdam*
- London
- Copenhagen
- Nantes
- Meppel
- San Francisco*
- Oakland

It could be debated whether [Meppel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meppel) is a city or not, but I'll let it.
