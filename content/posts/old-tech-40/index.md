Managing a home network on a shoe string budget is not easy. I am simply glad if most of the time our crappy old computer here keeps routing the internet. The hardware borking up the Debian install tends to happen from time to time. Then it is usually a frantic search for the last Sarge installer which was lying somewhere last week but now is hopelessly lost and reinstalling everything.

Hosting my blog and wiki on this crummy server is not a recipe for *less* stress. The blog was down shortly tonight, because I tried to install a wireless card in the server. My iBook is currently tethered to one of two places in the house and I want that to end.

Having the WiFi card in the pc was a very short exercise. It will not boot with the card plugged in. So there go my wireless dreams for the foreseeable future. Anybody know base stations which are cheaper than Apple's Airports?
