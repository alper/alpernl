There are some hot new [videos up on Miguel's blog](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2006/Feb-07-1.html) showing very sizzling Gnome desktop hardware acceleration. Watch the video's, especially the cube variant.

These are Novell's long awaited Xgl improvements and they will introduce a vast amount of Linux users to something which was commonplace on OS X years ago.

A big difference is that development of desktop eye candy on OS X is highly controlled. When the plugin architecture for this stuff is released into the wild, I expect to see a very great number of additions, fun stuff, experimental stuff on the Linux desktop. Most of it will probably be unusable, but let the long tail roll.

Then a [follow-up up on the development](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2006/Feb-07-2.html) of the Xgl stuff with a mail which is of such beauty that Nat says:

> ‘they should teach from [that mail](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2006-February/msg00115.html) in software classes’

Oh. I read the [CNet article](http://news.com.com/Novell+seeks+to+boost+Linux+graphics/2100-7344_3-6035862.html?tag=st.prev) and Nat is saying the exact same thing:

> “That's not something people can do on a Mac. I want to see 1,000 flowers bloom here.”

And indeed, these improvements are very timely with regards to the ever awaited Vista with its new graphics layer.
