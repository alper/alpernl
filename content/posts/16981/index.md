The past couple of weeks I had a bit of a weird feeling because there weren't any new episodes from Piratensender Powerplay. Then I found out Friedemann is out sick but also that they have a Patreon with extra episodes.

I immediately reallocated some pledges and am now supporting them. This is one of the best German podcasts and at times its level is up there with the top US podcasts I've listened to. Coming from me this is absurdly high praise.

Give it a listen:
