I'm still waiting for the pictures of Friday to air on [the IxDA Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ixda/albums) and for the video of my talk to be posted, but here are some notes I found around the web about my talk (for my personal notebook).

> Eigenlijk veel interessanter om 14:00 is ‘ [Conversations are the new interfaces](http://sched.co/5yOu)‘, van Alper Çuğun (nog een Nederlander!). Als de mensen van Hubbub iets doen rondom experimentele interfaces, dan let ik op. — [Vormfout.nl](http://www.vormfout.nl/nl/blog/ixd16-voorbereiding-dag-3/)

> Today Alper Çuğun will lead a session about ‘Conversations are the new interfaces’ and Marcel Schouwenaar will talk about ‘Trade-offs & Sharing’. — [Embassy of the Netherlands in Finland](https://www.facebook.com/netherlandsembassyhelsinki/posts/536205579873518)

> Alper Çuğun ( [@alper](https://twitter.com/alper)), who used to co-run a gaming company called [Hubbub](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/), talked about conversational interfaces. I've been really interested in these lately so I found it very helpful. He showed an example of a conversational UI that they developed and gave a rundown of do's and dont's when designing for them. One interesting insight was that they found that kids will read a lot of text if they get it in SMS-sized chunks. He smartly called conversational UIs the "UI for AI" and cautioned that they are not perfect for every use case. — [Aaron Ganci](http://aaronganci.com/blog/2016/3/7/interaction-16-day-three-recap)

> Another fantastic talk was from [Alper Çuğun](/dingen/). He gave an overview of conversational user interfaces. It was based on his own experience making mobile games that use conversations and messaging as the main mechanic. He also shared an analysis of the tools out there to make conversational UIs and a prediction of where the scene is heading.

> In particular, I was struck by how **conversations, like the messaging apps we’re all familiar with on our phones, can lower the barrier to people using technology.** It now feels very natural to text back and forth with friends. When machines can text with us, that might give us a sense of accessibility and agency in our interaction with them. — [Michelle Thorne](http://michellethorne.cc/2016/03/interaction16/)
