Katie recently [announced](http://katiesvlog.blogs.com/vlog/2006/03/cocoadevhouse_a.html) ([Upcoming](http://upcoming.org/event/61899/), [Macwereld](http://macwereld.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1209&Itemid=162)) on April 21st. CocoaDevHouse is an Amsterdam incarnation of similar popular unconferences across the world.

[CocoaDevHouse Amsterdam](http://cocoadevhouse.pbwiki.com/CocoaDevHouseAmsterdam) is going to be a really cool gathering where the technically fantastic meet up to create great things. I had missed [Barcamp Amsterdam](http://barcamp.org/BarCampAmsterdam), so this is my chance to catch up.
