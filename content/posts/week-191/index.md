Last week was the first week that I was back from the Levant. I have notes for the three weeks in between, but I think I'll skip those (though plenty of interesting stuff happened over there too).

Monday I presented an introduction on data for [Mobile Monday](http://www.mobilemonday.nl), roundup post here: [“The Rising Tide of Data on Mobile Monday”](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2010/11/the-rising-tide-of-data-on-mobile-monday-2/)

Tuesday we picked up development of [PLAY Pilots](http://playpilots.nl) for the next live game: [Bandjesland](http://playpilots.nl/games/bandjesland/). And that night an open data proposal we helped author was adopted by Amsterdam, write-up: [“Open Data in Amsterdam Center Adopted”](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2010/11/open-data-in-amsterdam-center-adopted/)

Wednesday and Thursday were spent doing roundup on data related issues (lots of stuff brewing) and further work on PLAY Pilots.

Friday I did a bit of consultancy for a next generation dating startup being spearheaded by three very nice friends.

And part of the weekend was spent preparing the [presentation for Social Media Club](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2010/11/next-weeks-public-appearances/) Utrecht.
