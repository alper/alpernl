[Maps for where you've been](https://tenpages.github.io/us-level/us.html) in Europe and the US ( [via](http://www.iamcal.com/2025-01/10229/)). Stayed means having spent a night there which means the only places I've visited and not spent the night are Slovenia (went over the border to hike a mountain there) and the Vatican.

I should probably upgrade Turkey to lived depending on your definition: stayed in your own house or registered as a resident.

My score for the US is negligible and I don't see this changing any time soon (maybe ever).
