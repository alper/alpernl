I just threw away 2 Gigabytes worth of podcasts waiting to be listened to. Who knew podcasts were such a storage hog. This batch can wait some more. I also unsubscribed from five or six podcasts.

I have pretty much had it with podcasts and won't bother with them unless the content or the speaker are really really good. I'm talking Malcolm Gladwell- or Bruce Sterling-good.

I don't have the time (who has?) to drudge through hours and hours of keynotes of mindless executives or startup drones going on and on about how their product is going to revolutionize the industry.

Make your argument in a one page writeup and blog it. If it is interesting I'll pick it up and scan it in due course.
