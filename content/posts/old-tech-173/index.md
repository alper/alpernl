I always thought our [Blackboard](http://blackboard.tudelft.nl) at DUT was a piece of crap. News that [they are patenting](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/02/1217219&from=rss) learning CMS has cemented my opinion.

There seem to be viable Open Source systems out there, but of course our university is not using those.
