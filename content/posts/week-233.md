Another long form weeknote, history recapping brought by the fantastic [Memolane](http://memolane.com/) service which aggregates my various media chronologically so I can quickly write this overview.

On Monday busy finishing a bunch of stuff and exercising my bureaucracy muscle by writing different varieties of administrativa.

Got started using [Amen](http://www.amenhq.com/) which is a ridiculous amount of fun. Any such service that relies on human input will need to be fun to start with to garner any amount of critical mass. I have some invites left for those that want them.

Also saw this zombie themed ARG running in Amsterdam throughout the week:

Tuesday saw the happy celebration of the Eid al Fitr (in our language called the şeker bayramı) along with work on culiacan.

This video regarding the internet and physical shutdowns of the SF BART is not to be missed:

Note the concept of a common carrier which is something we should have in Europe as well.

Also found this fab produced bike fender the [“Fendor Bendor”](http://www.pristinefixedgear.com/2011/03/31/wit-industries-presents-fender-bender/) (by Wit Industries) at the other office sitting in a rack:

Wednesday saw a day in Utrecht preparing for the trip to [dConstruct](http://2011.dconstruct.org/) to see [Kars Alfrink](http://hbbb.nl/) speak about [the Transformers](http://2011.dconstruct.org/conference/kars-alfrink).

Regarding the discussion that came back again: I do think that [designers should code](http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/9594863189), but that answer should be a bit obvious seeing as I am a creative technologist. It does deserve a blogpost of its own.

Thursday saw travel to the UK with a direct transfer to the [Moo](http://www.moo.com/) party taking place in Shoreditch. The expected group of hipsters and old friends had congregated on a parking lot (which was more fun than I make it sound right now). Met some interesting people doing similar things in the UK as we are over here (such as the organizer of the [Mozilla festival](https://mozillafestival.org/register/)).

Also read the shocking announcement that the prices for [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/) are going to increase some 30 times [when the service goes out of preview](http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/) (they call it a [‘new pricing model’](http://www.google.com/enterprise/cloud/appengine/pricing.html)). It was a formidable place for quickly developed applications that need to run solidly with little attention. I even gave a [presentation how it is \*better\* than Django](http://www.slideshare.net/alper/app-engine-beats-ponykey) for a certain class of developer needs. Now I do feel forced to cancel any subscription I have running there and to stop investing in that particular platform because running any serious application would be unsustainable at current pricing.

[Bashers](http://bashers.nl) launched [a linklog Beat](http://beat.bashers.nl/) for everything game related, which is worth browsing through on occasion.

On recommendations from highly regarded friends I bought The Information by James Gleick though I already get the feeling that I am not going to read a lot of new things in there (seeing as our history of informatics, science philosophy and information theory classes in university were pretty thorough):
[![Airplane reading - €10](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6068/6102815761_1458f7e005_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/6102815761/ "Airplane reading - €10 by illustir, on Flickr")

Upon entering the UK I was hit by some encounters still reminiscent of the social problems that just recently plagued London. That and the general grittiness of the parts of London we went through gave me a lot of misgivings about the city. I am pretty sure I'm not going to go to London ‘for fun’ anytime soon and I found myself very glad to be living in Amsterdam.

[dConstruct](http://dconstruct.org) contained some gems and some platitudinous talks as was expected. Me and my friends appreciate a different talk than the agency based web people that also attend which must put conference organizers in something of a bind when programming.

It was a lot of fun to hang around with my crew of [Iskander Smit](http://targetisnew.com/), [Taco Ekkel](http://tacoekkel.nl/) and [Kars Alfrink](http://hbbb.nl) (who gave a terrific and hard hitting presentation) and to meet people such as [Ben Bashford](http://www.benbashford.com/), [Sjors Timmer](http://notura.com/), [Marrije Schaake](http://www.eend.nl/), [Albert de Klein](http://albertdeklein.nl/) and many others I forget to name.

Saturday was spent recuperating from the trip and on Sunday more of the same. I celebrated my fifth Twitterversary and both of the offices I keep in Amsterdam (the [Volkskrantgebouw](http://www.volkskrantgebouw.nl/) and the [Open Coop](http://www.opencooperatie.nl/)) were featured in the [Parool](http://parool.nl) magazine:
