I hate Github as much as the next person. A platform with a lot of promise has—in Microsoft's hands—devolved into a veritable dump.

What is not a good response in such a situation is to call the people who work on Github "monkeys" as Andrew Kelley does in [Zig's exit post](https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/).

What's wrong here?

- Calling people monkeys (or any other animal) is unacceptable in private conversation.
- Calling them so in a public post representing an organization is extremely unprofessional.
- Calling people like that if almost certainly a significant number of them are non-white is uncivilized.

The post has since been edited because most likely there were some people in Andrew Kelley's organization or environment who had some common sense.
