I am currently following a course on internet technology aptly named *“Internet Technology”*. The contents of the course are unfortunately horribly outdated and detached from reality.

I offered the teacher to give a talk about current issues in webservices, standards, accessibility, ajax and whatnot. I could unleash a whole torrent of Web 2.0 [superciliousness](http://supr.c.ilio.us/) onto the classroom, get mad propz and polish my presenting skills in the process.

I proposed to do this (and essentially relieve my teacher's work load) but I was denied because of pressing time concerns.

A positive side about this course is that the research assignment is completely free. I am planning to make a kick ass assignment on either [Identity 2.0](http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/) or on [Google Base](http://base.google.com/base/).
