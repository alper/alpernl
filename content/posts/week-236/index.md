Monday

Thinking of stuff to do while in Berlin and underemployed (in the beginning maybe).

Last week's Pirate Party victory in Berlin where they got 10% of the vote should serve as a wake-up call to left-ish political parties that are paying lip service to the internet. There is a massive untapped populace who are completely disillusioned with the out of touch politics of today. GroenLinks and D'66's only luck right now is that the Dutch Pirate Party is so incompetent for now.

And it seems that time travel maps are still popular while we still don't have access to the data. Here's a project being executed by my office mate [Arjan Scherpenisse](http://twitter.com/acscherp):

Skimmed this book by the Council for Social Development (RMO) about the public debate in the age of the internet:

Tuesday

Our friends at [Two for Joy Coffee Roasters](http://www.twoforjoy.nl/) have opened their second store in Amsterdam. It's a new favorite place to work and meet:

Kars put [the slides for his dconstruct talk](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2011/09/the-transformers-at-dconstruct-2011/) on the Transformers online. Well worth a read for a realistic view on the city and games.

Work on Apps voor Nederland and culiacan working at pace. I'm very proud of the community that is coming together.

Wednesday

I dropped by [Ernst-Jan Pfauth](https://twitter.com/#!/ejpfauth) and [Ward Wijndelts](https://twitter.com/#!/wardwijndelts) who are settling in their new offices for their startup:

I concluded the day by chairing the jury deliberations for [Apps for Noord-Holland](http://appsfornoordholland.nl). The day was concluded with the [award ceremony](http://www.appsvoornederland.nl/nieuws/uitslag-apps4nh) and festivities.

Thursday

Finished reading [The City & The City](http://readmill.com/alper/reads/the-city-the-city) by China Miéville. A poignant book. The science-fiction book for this year. I read it on [Readmill](http://readmill.com) which is a pleasant enough reading experience but I don't know yet if it will be the home of my future library.

Dropped by the great design team at [Buro Pony](http://buropony.nl) in Rotterdam to discuss the future of the specialty design store: [Dufarge](http://dufarge.com).

Met with [Christian Friedrich](http://bk.tudelft.nl/index.php?id=15158&L=1) at Rotterdam's new espresso bar [Hopper](https://twitter.com/#!/HopperCoffee).

Caught up a bit on the Fyra back with [Yuri van Geest](https://twitter.com/#!/vangeest). A pleasure as always.

Friday

[![Say what you will, the hipster life is a good one.](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6169/6174841060_25ce8dbbc2_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/6174841060/ "Say what you will, the hipster life is a good one. by illustir, on Flickr")

Friday was concluded in Utrecht with more writing and working at the [Hubbub](http://hbbb.nl) studio.

We had a great time playing [The Resistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_(party_game)) a mashup between Mastermind and Werewolf.

[![Playing The Resistance, there are spies among us!](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6175721832_308d9e7f98_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/6175721832/ "Playing The Resistance, there are spies among us! by illustir, on Flickr")

Yes, that is the best we have found thusfar for a [Microsoft Surface Table](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/default.aspx).

Catching up on the news of the week in die Zeit, here a profile of all the elected Pirates:
[![Almost all the newly elected pirates make software or studied sciences (i.e. politicians who can do mats)](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6180533161_cb5b33c9e7_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/6180533161/ "Almost all the newly elected pirates make software or studied sciences (i.e. politicians who can do mats) by illustir, on Flickr")

Most of them have either studied sciences or work in IT (or both). Politicians who can do maths. That may be an actual solution to the economic crisis we are in.

And an editorial about the lack of responsibility in society both on the macro as in the microscale:
[![“nun sollen die anderen auch meine Schuld übernehmen.”](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6181170082_96f8490a07_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/6181170082/ "“nun sollen die anderen auch meine Schuld übernehmen.”by illustir, on Flickr")
