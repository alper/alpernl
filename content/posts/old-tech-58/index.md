Being at a different location and not having WiFi internet available (like at my parents' place) is seriously disturbing. There was a wireless network within range but it was password protected.

Wouldn't it be nice if everybody opened up their wireless for passers by to use?

Enter [FoN](http://gigaom.com/2005/12/04/foning-a-wifi-revolution/). It's not completely perfect but it has a lot of ideas headed into the right direction.

Recognizing the vital importance of free WiFi should be (for institutions) the incentive to open up their networks. For people it could be more motivated by hospitality and kindness.

Anyway, I don't care why you do it. I just do not want to pay €5 for 30 minutes of internet access. Paying for internet by the minute? That is so last century and it wasn't even cool back then.
