I got my Macbook back just two hours ago. They assure me they could not find anything but the trackpad button feels more responsive than when I handed it in. I don't think I'm imagining things, though.

More responsive is still nothing to write home about but if the last two weeks have taught me anything is that *a* Macbook is better than no Macbook.

Now first let me catchup with two weeks of unread stuff in Netnewswire. Will keep posted.
