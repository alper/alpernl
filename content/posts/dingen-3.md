The train I had to catch this morning only went after 9h so I thought I'd take the opportunity to get a real breakfast for the first time. Scale is as good as mentioned and people were lining up before opening time to get in on the action. I attacked the plate I got like a wild animal and was well underway to the FamilyMart and the train station by 08:30.

The train to Mikisato it is. I could read it even without a western spelling because it's just three 三 tree 木 village 里. That means there's probably two and four shikisato villages out there as well.

At Mikisato I a man with his parents and himself carrying a baby struggled to get on the train. There's only one door that opens on these single driver operated units. After we helped them to get on, I called out: "How did you guys end up here?" He said he lived there and they drove off. That's cool and all, but how do you live somewhere and not know how the trains work?

The goal today was to get to Kumano since I [read that it could be done](https://walkkumano.com/iseji/#day7).

From Mikisato quickly the double whammy of [Miki-toge/Hago-toge](https://www.kodo.pref.mie.lg.jp/en/course/11.html). It rained a lot last night, so everything was really slippery. On the trailhead here they thoughtfully provided sticks again to ward off the bears. I would like to buy one of these as a memento.

I'm also extremely regretting not bringing my hiking poles. I think calling this a "walk" really threw me off. This is very much a hike and a rather strenuous one at that.

I didn't really see very many shrines today. I was getting a bit worried until I finally found one here. This statue was flanked by two massive phalli.

I found another book and the people there also report zero bears but say they did see monkeys. I'm sad that I didn't see any monkeys.

Then it's down already to Kata. The problem with walking from coastal town to coastal town is that you're going to have to go to 0 altimeters every time.

Kata didn't have fishing rights historically. Weird how one town next to the sea would be able to get them and the next wouldn't. Now it looks like they're redoing their bridge entirely. More infrastructure investment that is impossible to find in Germany.

I sit down and eat some of the snacks I brought. There is no convenience store on this entire stretch which tells you something about how remote it is.

The next pass, [Sone Jiro-zaka Taro-zaka](https://www.kodo.pref.mie.lg.jp/en/course/12.html) went all the way up to 350m of altitude. Just as much as the mountain pass yesterday. It did feel a bunch easier though.

After the point of the pass though, every time I thought it was going to go down now, another section of climbing followed. So up and down it went for a long time after which we had to drop the entire 300m in a very short distance before getting back down to Nigishima.

On the way down it became obvious that my knee wasn't really feeling this one and it took about as long to get down as it took to get up so with that the 3h in the description for the pass remain accurate, at least for me. Also with it now being after 2pm it was clear that I wasn't going to do another one of these, let alone a bunch more walking to Kumano.

So I broke off the plan to push on and stuck with my already booked accommodation in Atashika. I confirmed dinner and breakfast to be provided because there is absolutely nothing here and then waited for the train.

There are worse ways to spend two hours than sitting in a gazebo in a tiny port town watching the people drop by to use the public toilet while drinking hot beverages from the vending machine.

It’s very nice not to have to walk to the next station. It’s nice to be able to miss plan and then still replan and reschedule accordingly imagine being in the mountains and having to catch a specific train like that like in the Alps it’s horrible.

The train came at 16:18 as promised and after a short hop to Atashika I made my walk to my lodgings. I phoned my kids while walking and by the time I got there it was getting really dark and you do not want to be stuck up on a backroad in the mountains when it's dark really.

This is a guesthouse run by a lovely 78 year old retired woman who's studying English and has traveled all over the world. I wondered why people would live in these towns but they moved here after retirement and from this spot up on the hill her living room has a sea view. Now I understand.
