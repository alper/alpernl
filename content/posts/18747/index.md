Just through sheer coincidence I'm reading the notes on [the closure of FF Studio](https://notes.annagoss.co/closing-ff/).

I had no idea they existed nor had I seen any of their amazing work. I'm just glad that there are still people believing in novel, interesting ways of working.

Many of the positives and the negatives are all too familiar though stuff like this is easier said than done:

- Take more risks
- Be even more transparent
- Experiment harder

Following some links, I found [garden3d](https://garden3d.net) who take resisting the “traditional agency” thinking to something of a conclusion.

> The “Traditional Agency™” reads a client’s RFP, sizes up the client’s wallet, and lobs a proposal over the wall. The agency has a lot of experience, and this client is a big company, so why not make an extra couple bucks?
