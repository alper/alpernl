Switching to full screen presenter mode in [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/) sometimes completely crashes (as in hard reset) my Macbook.

I've been playing around a bit with the **Web View** feature of Keynote, where you can embed a web page in a presentation. Clicking the page takes you to Safari to demo and you can then —in principle— resume your presentation again.

Several times already making the switch from full screen or back to it, has caused my Macbook to crash hard and emit the reboot chime of death.

Would this be embarassing if it happened during a real life presentation? You bet it would.
