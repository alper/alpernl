The diagnosis here about the unique German problem with Datenschutz is mostly correct. Of course other European countries manage to have privacy without working themselves in a huff around Datenschutz. How could that be?

The causes mentioned are correct:

1. There are too many people working in law and compliance in Germany who do nothing but create paper and slow everything down. Lots of people's livelihoods depend on absurd regulations being there.
1. The chilling effect around these regulations has contributed to a low risk appetite and a culture where problems are maintained instead of being solved.

But the real reason of course why things are like this here but not elsewhere is culture. It's always culture.
