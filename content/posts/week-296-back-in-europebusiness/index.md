After some weeks traveling to Beijing and Australia, last week I was back in Europe, touching down in Amsterdam Tuesday morning early. I had a very nice flight in from Sydney with the only annoyance being that my laptop had broken upon arrival there. This made me spend half a day of the two I had there in the [Bondi Apple Store](http://www.apple.com/au/retail/bondi/) trying to figure out what the problem was.

The Genius there was less than helpful. Determining that it was my hard drive, he tried without avail to erase it and then load up a new version of the OS. I am more or less pleased that he wasn't successful in doing that. In Amsterdam I tried another couple of things but finally handed it in at [Maccare.nl](http://www.maccare.nl/) who without touching it said ‘it was probably the cable’ and the very same day had replaced it for me. Since the Genius hadn't even managed to erase my disk, I could incredulously resume working from where I was a week ago.

Not having a laptop I did manage to finish [The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoete](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7141642-the-thousand-autumns-of-jacob-de-zoet) and a [Monocle](http://monocle.com/) on the flights from Sydney to Guangzhou to Amsterdam and the layover.

The following day I handed my laptop in and while it was being fixed, I worked the day in Utrecht where using Chrome's sign-in feature, I could resume most of my old work on an old [Hubbub](http://hbbb.nl) Macbook. It turns out the cloud is not a lie at all.

Thursday morning I got my Macbook Pro back and spent most of the day working at Brainsley's offices which are small but rather cozy. I dropped by the [Open Coop](http://www.opencoop.nl/) to chat with Lex and pick up my [Open State](http://openstate.eu/) business cards. And that night I met up with some old friends who work now mostly as hired guns in the Amsterdam startup scene for cocktails at the famed [Door 74](https://foursquare.com/v/door-74/4a982d4bf964a520d12a20e3).

Friday I dropped by [the Village](http://www.thevillagecoffee.nl/) (again!) and then got onto the train to Berlin where I am typing this right now.
