[Talking about](/dingen/2008/07/pre-holiday-wrapping-up/) catching waves, I had been annoyed majorly by the uselessness of Safari not incorporating any decent URL shortcut function ((Like Firefox and Opera have had for ages.)) without either a [paid for extension](http://pimpmysafari.com/plugins/saft) or a dreadful [input manager hack](http://safarikeywords.sourceforge.net/).

Now [Shaun Inman has launched](http://shauninman.com/archive/2008/07/06/catch_a_shortwave) a somewhat more circumspect but more cross platform way of invoking the same functionality: [Shortwave](http://shortwaveapp.com/). His [initial list](http://shortwaveapp.com/waves.txt), though useful is not what I would use the functionality most for in my Saft days. So I've added some links to dictionaries I use a lot and some I don't use that much: [alper.nl/wave.txt](/wave.txt)

Additions for the linguist's shortwave are most welcome. Still looking for decent French, Mandarin, Arabic and Russian dictionaries.
