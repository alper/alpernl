I've spent June until October writing a brief but comprehensive book called [“Designing Conversational Interfaces”](http://www.convbook.com/) introducing the creation of messaging applications and chatbots to a non-technical audience.

You can purchase the book on [Gumroad](http://www.convbook.com/) or review it on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32560547-designing-conversational-interfaces).
