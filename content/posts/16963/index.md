Complaining is easy. Learning how your organization works as described here by Cindy Sridharan is hard. Which of the two do you prefer to do?

> - The mirage of aspiration
> - Know how your org works
> - Soft skills are hard skills
> - Understand implicit hierarchies
> - Cultures: top-down, bottom-up and both
> - Get comfortable with the 'mess'
> - Look for small (and any) wins
> - Understand org constraints and manage your expectations

"Get comfortable with the 'mess'" and I can let you in on a small secret: everything is a mess.
