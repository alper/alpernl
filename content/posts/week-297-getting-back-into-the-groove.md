At the start of the week I managed to [upload a batch of trip pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/archives/date-posted/2012/11/19/) (the China section) but after things went quickly downhill.

I spent the first three days of the week wrapped up mostly in visa procedures because I'll be [participating in the Moscow Urban Forum](http://mosurbanforum.ru/speakers/speakers_2012/alper_cugun_niderlandy/) next week. I did manage to have some good chats in between, but attention was too scattered to get anything solid done (also this being the first week back from a reasonably long trip). Lunch with [Fabian Mürmann](http://fabian.mu/), a board meeting for [Open State](http://openstate.eu/).

I did discover a very nice coffee place around the corner and went there for just about every day since (I think this is love).

Add to that two visits to the dentist as well on subsequent days and I was more or less done.

Friday was the first day where I could finally catchup with most things. I dropped by [Gidsy](http://gidsy.com/) and had lunch with [Matt Patterson](http://constituentparts.com/) and then lunch again with my office mates. And the evening I prepped a session for the students from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences to tell them more or less everything I could about data visualization in 90 slides.

And on Sunday I finished [my first book by James C. Scott](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14891877-two-cheers-for-anarchism) which was fantastic (more on which later) and managed to finally get a secret little project underway that had been lying for far too long.
