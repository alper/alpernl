The year has started nicely and the event line-up is already brimful.

Thursday a week ago saw [the iBestuur Congress](http://www.ibestuurcongres.nl/) in the Netherlands where the winners of the [Apps voor Nederland](http://www.appsvoornederland.nl/) competition were announced. I'm happy to see this last app competition to a succesful end and I look forward to what more we can bring. See [a write-up of them](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/2012/01/apps-for-the-netherlands-gold-silver-and-bronze/) over at the Hack de Overheid site.

Last weekend I was joined here by fellow game makers from the Netherlands to participate in the Berlin Global Game Jam. We fought hard and managed to crank out the unparalleled [Nakatomi Rider](http://globalgamejam.org/2012/nakatomi-rider). Niels wrote it up for the papers (available [over at Bashers](http://bashers.nl/ggj12-nakatomi-rider)).

This week in Berlin the Transmediale takes place to which I hope to go in the following days. I have a difficult relationship with art, especially when it is in the domain of media, but watching the [Graham Harman](http://doctorzamalek2.wordpress.com/) lecture tonight and the introduction to it, it was clear to me that [Transmediale](http://www.transmediale.de/) is as on top of current developments and artistic relevance as they can be.

### Upcoming

There will be [a night in Pakhuis de Zwijger](http://www.dezwijger.nl/page/42476/nl) to celebrate the Nederland van Boven television series that the VPRO produced in the Netherlands ((Borrowing conceptually from Britain from Above among others.)). I will be joining the esteemed panel there as a board member of Hack de Overheid to talk about issues of democracy, participation and truth in cartography.

With [Martijn de Waal](http://martijndewaal.nl/) happily having gotten his PhD ((Whose thesis I am very much looking forward to read, which is something of an exception when it comes to theses.)), it's now full steam ahead for the conference he is organizing together with [Michiel de Lange](http://www.bijt.org/) called [“Social Cities of Tomorrow”](http://www.socialcitiesoftomorrow.nl/) ((As luck will have it last year I travelled from Amsterdam to Berlin for a virtual urbanism conference and this year I will do the reverse (though with a brief trip to Madrid tacked to its end).)). I will be speaking in a brief time slot about [Apps for Amsterdam](http://www.appsforamsterdam.nl/) and how data commons happen.

I will probably be attending [LIFT](http://liftconference.com/) to [see a certain person speak](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2012/01/talks-lined-up-for-the-start-of-2012/).

Finally in the near future there is also an undisclosed Berlin event for which I will be speaking which will be my first abroad since I left the Netherlands.
