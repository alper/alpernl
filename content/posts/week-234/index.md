On Monday I let go a bunch of stalling side projects which were not going anywhere.

Blogged about [the Foursquare screen we made](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2011/09/foursquare-map-for-leidse-square-%E2%80%98entertainment-area%E2%80%99-in-effect/) with a video which finally wrapped up that project (try to find a slot between 12:00 and 17:00 to make it to Leidseplein on a workday).

Interesting bit of news that TfL is implementing [systems to prevent Oyster overcharging](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14784865). This is where the transit card in the Netherlands is used as a way to surreptitiously draw money from unsuspecting travelers.

Found this random shirt design site: [Zufallsshirt.de](http://zufallsshirt.de/)

Wrote [a small review in Dutch](/dingen/2011/09/ik-ben-bereid/) of the theater experience [De Club](http://www.declub.nu/) we went to last week. It aims to be an engine for social change instead of a traditional play, but in that respect it is somewhat lacking still. We are somewhat interested because this —creating systems that yield interesting experiences— is our work.

Tuesday I finally got to see this video from our [visit to the fortress](http://www.appsfornoordholland.nl/):

We are quite busy planning the next events for [Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/).

Wednesday was spent working in Utrecht and I got featured in an interview where I called out gamification for the bullshit it is at Virtueel Platform: [“De keerzijde van gamification”](http://virtueelplatform.nl/kennis/de-keerzijde-van-gamification/)

Thursday my profile got [featured on The Next Speaker](http://thenextspeaker.com/nl/experts/alper-cugun/) where you can now hire me to present at your event.

Amsterdam is also increasingly getting more machine readable:

We are also very glad with [the funding of Venus Patrol](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/774616737/venus-patrol-charting-a-new-course-for-videogame-c) a publication that we hope can shed a new light on the relation of games and culture.

I was present at the launch of a new Dutch Literature Magazine: [Das Magazin](http://dasmagazin.nl/) (yes, German name…).

[![Toine launching das Magazin by talking about slurred hubris](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6127757430_56ceaff3cb_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/6127757430/ "Toine launching das Magazin by talking about slurred hubris by illustir, on Flickr")

Friday after breakfast with [Dirk van Oosterbosch](http://www.ixopusada.com/dirk/) en [Alexander Zeh](http://www.alexanderzeh.me/), I helped out with painting the [Open Cooperatie](http://www.opencooperatie.nl/).
