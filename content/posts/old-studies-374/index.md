So finally this feels like real work. I read one of the papers I had copied from the proceedings of the [Conference of Computer Ethics](http://cepe2005.utwente.nl/) by Introna called:

> “Strangers and hospitality: on the social and ethical conditions of virtual communities”

This is an interesting paper for me giving me some needed context for communities and especially for this paper of hospitality.

It was my first contact with Heidegger's phenomenological philosophy and the first time I have ever heard of Levinas and his philosophies of the Other and the Third.

I looked both of these up in Wikipedia to get some founding. So I'm crash coursing myself through philosophy.

I made extensive [notes](/wiki/index.php/Literature_List#Notes) with interesting parts and parts where I have more questions.
