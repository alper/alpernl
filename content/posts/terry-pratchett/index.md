Though I didn't read him for very long, Terry Pratchett's books in the local library translated to Dutch were my introduction to both fantasy and a certain kind of critical way of looking at the world. Only now I'm finding out how many other people were deeply influenced by Pratchett. I'm also glad to see how a literary establishment that had studiously ignored him and all genre fiction for all that time now has no other choice but to admit that they were wrong.
