The week was mostly spent doing stuff for either [Statlas](http://statlas.nl) or for another project on the essence of architecture.

We also submitted the final version of the paper that we are presenting on Chi Sparks next week in the [Games and play track](http://chi-sparks.nl/program/session/games-and-play).

Friday a brief review I wrote the week before of [Inside a Star-filled Sky](http://insideastarfilledsky.net/) was [published in nrc.next](http://instagr.am/p/F3IGJ/). This may become a more regular fixture.

The afternoon was spent together with Lex at the [Waag](http://waag.org) concepting the tentatively titled ‘Apps on the Beach’ event.
