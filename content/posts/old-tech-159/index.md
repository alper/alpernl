I cut this from the previous Macbook related post:

> “I am a power user and evangelist of Apple computers. They should be nicer to me.”

I really am advertising my Apple to anybody who will see it and several people already have bought Apple computers on my recommendations and I am fairly confident more are ready to be converted.

Shouldn't I qualify for a special evangelizer's pass or something, to get better service, cut ahead lines and get digital hugs from Steve?

Apple is one thing, the franchise store on the Lijnbaan in Rotterdam (it is *not* a real Apple store) is another. My attempt to reach them yesterday was thwarted by the Dutch Rail's massive equipment failures, but I am going to try again today.

Let's see if they are worthy of my patronage.
