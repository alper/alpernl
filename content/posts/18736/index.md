Now we see the inevitable walk backs of "coding agents will replace all software engineers".

What the cursor CEO is saying here should be obvious but no amount of repeating it will drive it home for most people: With code becoming cheap, it still important (maybe even more so now) to build the right thing and build it right.

This statement never managed to reach people before LLMs and there's nothing that has changed that would make it any different. Building the right thing is the job. Some teams will struggle at this, others won't and it will be impossible to tell the difference until late in the game.
