An extremely damning account of the way Vice and also the NYT have treated Naomi Wu with some choice bad behaviour from [people like Doctorow in part 2](https://medium.com/@therealsexycyborg/shenzhen-tech-girl-naomi-wu-part-2-over-the-wall-and-into-the-fire-5e8efc5c1509) as well.

I get that she got into it a bit naive like many people do when it comes to esteemed publications like the Times. I've been at the backstage of an event once where there were people from the NYT and everybody there is ass kissing them all the time because they want to either 1. be covered positively in the 'paper of record' or 2. get a job there since it's one of the last places paying journalists well. In such an environment, it's hard not to believe that you are better than others.
