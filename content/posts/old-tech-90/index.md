Sun is [giving away servers](http://www.sun.com/secure/servers/coolthreads/tnb/qualify.jsp) for trial [[via](http://www.somedaysarebetterthanothers.com/content/pages/archives/02-06/l131.html)] and maybe even for keeps.

Desperation or marketing genius? Anyway it is bound to elecit quite some blog storm.

**Update:** Yes, the stunt was so daft that Schwartz needs to [clarify stuff on his blog](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?entry=niagara_free_trial_update).
