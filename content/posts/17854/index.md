Hans de Zwart's end of the year media overviews are one of the highlights of what still happens on personal blogs for me. He's a voracious reader and one of the rare people who acts on his moral clarity. Also, Hans is a great guy and I had the chance to briefly catch-up with him last year.

I'll see if I can pull something together, but definitely go through his list. I always pick up more than a couple of interesting things to explore.
