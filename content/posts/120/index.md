I had my [Yashica D](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/2226513597/) repaired and also recently acquired [a lightmeter](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/3628509161/) to make the process of shooting easier and now I'm slowly but surely shooting stuff with it.

And added to that I'm completely untrained and have hardly any experience with this stuff, so who knows how much improvement is still possible. Here's to film in a digital age.
