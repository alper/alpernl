The idea that German television is necessarily terrible has to be reconsidered. I've recently started watching [Deutschland '83](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschland_83) which is amazing (more on that later) and yesterday I finished season two of the web series Mann/Frau by [BR PULS](http://www.br.de/puls/index.html).

[Mann/Frau](http://blog.br.de/mannfrau/) is a mirror format byte-sized episodic where each installment details the interactions of a man and a woman their relations and lives. It treats most of the themes occupying people around my age living in Berlin but manages to do so drawing more from slapstick than from cliché.

The series is helped enormously by the fact that each episode concludes somewhere under five minutes. Brevity unfortunately is a rare commodity in Germany. The benefits of it here are that it forces them to get to the point quickly, cut rapidly and finish. Episodes of this length also greatly facilitate binge watching ((They released all 20 season two episodes on YouTube at once.)). I had never considered you could make a traditional format series with episodes this short, but it works fine.

Halfway through I did develop an intense distaste for the man ( [Mirko Lang](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1065807/) ((Funnily enough this series isn't listed in his filmography anywhere because I guess it is a web series.))) and the man episodes. This isn't just because the man character is a huge doofus, but also because it turns out that the man and woman episodes are written and directed by a brother and sister respectively. The woman episodes are more punchy, contain less whining and more action.

In this interview with the brother and sister directors the problem becomes painfully obvious. During the entire interview the brother does most of the talking but doesn't say anything of substance.

I will keep watching when the next season comes out but I might just fast forward through most of the man's episodes.

These series may have a catalytic effect on the German television landscape. By their very existence they educate the tastes of an audience that might not have known or expected something like this to be possible. And actually creating something good in turn makes it so that other tv makers can't hide behind the excuse that the whole landscape is mediocre. Who knows what more may be possible.
