[Reinier implemented](http://ed-me.blogspot.com/2005/12/canvas-tag-and-my-javascript.html) what I always thought was a pretty fun game: [Closeline](http://www.zwitserloot.com/closeline/).

Getting it to play was usually a big pain in the ass because he had an implementation in written in assembler[^1] and it always had problems with joystick recognition and stuff like that (this is how it has stuck in my mind).

So thank god for the web and its newfound cross platformness (for everyone except for [IE](http://www.killbillsbrowser.com)).

[^1]: The Javascript code for this version (which I strongly suggest you do not look at) still bears that heritage. It reads like a direct rewrite of the original assembler code. Mind putting that on the web as well, Reinier?
