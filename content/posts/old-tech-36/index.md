As [mentioned before](/blog/tech/29) there was a social drink after the Adaptive Path workshop in Amsterdam yesterday. It was great.

There were a lot of people from the Amsterdam User Interaction scene present, who had either attended the workshop or had friends or colleagues who had. It was pretty crowded upstairs at the Cantina and the atmosphere was very positive.

I have already attended a meeting from [the webstandards people](http://www.happyclog.nl/) and it's good to see the UI people have similar meetings.

[Jesse James Garrett](http://blog.jjg.net/) was present [wearing an AJAX shirt](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaeru/60887466/). I talked to him briefly and to lots of other people. It's nice to be able to talk to people about Flickr or Delicious without having to explain all of the basic concepts.

There were some people present from [Info.nl](http://www.info.nl). They have [a group blog](http://open.info.nl) on which I comment sometimes and the photograph on Kars's Flickr stream prompted me to attend today. Coincidentally at Info.nl they use software from the company I work for: [Topdesk](http://www.topdesk.nl).

I also talked to Jasper and Taco from [Medialab](http://www.medialab.nl) who have a search application that looks pretty flashy and to Tjeerd from [User Intelligence](http://www.userintelligence.com) who is also involved in [SigChi](http://www.sigchi.nl). We thought it strange that I had never heard of SigChi's activities and that SigChi has no real base in Delft. We might change that.
