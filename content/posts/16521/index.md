I feel this list by Dan Na of what it means to switch to the management track and this point in particular is more or less what my days consist of (intensity, attention, feeling): "Management forces you to care more about everything."

I am the ultimate person who has to care, who has to pay attention and who has to bring the intensity to drive things forward.
