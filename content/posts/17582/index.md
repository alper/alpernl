Long distance bike packing races however brutal they may be look like they fulfil an ideal. They have an activity that's not that fast but where you can still cover a lot of distance and terrain. The contestants are physically and mentally absurdly fit and still they go through hell. The remoteness of the locations usually creates a special connection to the local people and culture.

It's something more people should do or at least aspire to.
