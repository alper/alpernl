Not hugely satisfying but still a nice read. Supposedly the first book in this series is better.

> A hasty temper was one of the greatest faults a general could have, and people who were provoked by insults were easy to defeat.

> “You think China’s sending in peacekeepers again?”

> When the sea levels rose, they built huge dikes to protect their coastlines, and floated their greatest cities on the waves, like they did with Island Shanghai.

> Now, she swung the machete with expert strength. City girl learning country living.

> It was submerged again, but it had been terrifying—beast and human welded together in an unholy mix.

> Soldier boys would’ve loved it. Battle to the death. Epic ring.

> “I ain’t started cutting, yet.”“So you’re starting with her tongue?”“Gotta start somewhere.”

> Scout the town. See if we got any more castoffs. Maybe we got a whole nest of China rats we don’t know about.

> It was foolish to think that there was anything left to save energy for, but it was his nature. He had been designed too well.

> Full-grown. Unusual in the Drowned Cities, where war ate its young long before they reached maturity.

> Full-grown. Unusual in the Drowned Cities, where war ate its young long before they reached maturity.

> She’d seen people stand up, determined to hold on to principles. People who thought there was right and wrong. People who tried to save others.

> He would have stood tall. And the soldier boys would have shot his head right off and gone on to someone else without a second thought.

> I’m sure whoever first started questioning their political opponents’ patriotism thought they were being quite clever.

> You didn’t want to overthink. It just got you confused, and it got you killed.

> Nobody wanted a castoff reminding them how China had taken everything over for more than a decade, telling everyone what to do and how to live.

> “Generals are in the habit of using up all the people around them. It’s their job. It’s what they do best.”
