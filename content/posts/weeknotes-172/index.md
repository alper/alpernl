### Monday

Continuation of [Ebi](http://leapfrog.nl/blog/archives/tags/ebi/) and first deployment to the server. One of my biggest beefs with Django is that any fresh deploy to a server will cost you at least one hour, despite it being the same old stuff you have been doing for ever (as [opposed to App Engine](http://www.slideshare.net/alper/app-engine-beats-ponykey)).

### Tuesday

Ran some updates on [Haitinu.nl](http://haitinu.nl) which is an aid site that I delivered recently.

Continued with Ebi and prepared a talk with the people that run our [national transit information site](http://www.9292ov.nl).

### Wednesday

Done an Ebi brainstorm and progress review in Utrecht.

Then back to Amsterdam for the transit information meeting with [@mdebruin](http://twitter.com/mdebruin), [@jelleprins](http://twitter.com/jelleprins) and [@alexandernl](http://twitter.com/alexandernl).

I skipped the douchebag extremism of Social Media Day in favour of a book presentation on journalism by [Alexander Pleijter](http://twitter.com/apleijter) and [Arjan Dasselaar](http://twitter.com/arjandasselaar) in Dauphine which was next to my house (and where a bunch of friends from [the ‘Confetti generation’](http://www.mobypicture.com/user/timdegier1/view/6934920) were checked in).

It was entertaining enough and confirmed again how out of touch with the internet the journalism profession is.

### Thursday

Inbox management and Ebi.

### Friday

Did another sprint on Ebi and got out of Utrecht before [the match](http://nos.nl/wk2010/video/169249-wk-nederland--brazilie.html) started.

### Sunday

Had a nice 4th of July BBQ and squeezed in some pre-Monday updates to the Ebi site.
