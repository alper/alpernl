As of right now I'm frightfully behind on my Latour MOOC. What I have been doing instead is reading up old articles in my Instapaper. One such is this [interview with Dutch sociologist/philosopher Willem Schinkel in Vrij Nederland](http://www.vn.nl/Archief/Samenleving/Artikel-Samenleving/Laten-we-weer-utopisch-denken.htm). It's good to read a fresh Dutch thinker who seems to understand things (and who also [is in with Latour](http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&q=willem+schinkel+latour&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp=)). Calling Geert Wilders a proto-fascist and the Netherlands a museum are only a couple of the ringers in there.

The disappointing bit came at the end where he confessed to not having a cell phone out of principle. This is a terrible bit of intellectual laziness which brings me to [this point on Sloterdijk by Adam Greenfield](http://speedbird.wordpress.com/2014/02/23/tftd-2/) which rings true:

> The task before us is to discover, or invent, a politics, a mobility and a conviviality that are both authentic to the circumstances in which we find ourselves and capable of giving full expression to the emancipatory potential that remains latent and unrealized in our networked technologies.
