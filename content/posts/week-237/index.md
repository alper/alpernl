Last week's weeknotes were still due. I built a small public transportation exploration called: [AMStransit](http://amstransit.monsterswell.com) which is a dynamic glanceable display for nearby public transit in Amsterdam: [example](http://amstransit.monsterswell.com/?halteids=021321,021331,021362,021432,023012,023022).

Work on Apps voor Nederland and _culiacan_ continues apace.

Visited Gamelab to see contributions by all-stars [Karel Millenaar](http://www.fourcelabs.com/), [Niels 't Hooft](http://nielsthooft.com/) and [David Nieborg](http://www.gamespace.nl/).

Also an interview I gave about Hack de Overheid was published under the great title [“How to Make the Skunk Work With Open Data”](http://www.openkent.org.uk/index.php?cID=199) ( [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/noelito/status/119358278110158848)).

Finally I went to [/dev/haag](http://devhaag.nl/) to present about the current state of [Hack de Overheid](http://hackdeoverheid.nl) (which is really pretty good).
