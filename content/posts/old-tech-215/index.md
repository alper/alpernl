I have spent today at [GrowthTalk](http://www.growthtalk.com/) and will be spending tomorrow brainstorming concepts at [Innovation Playground](http://www.innovationplayground.net/).

I'll be writing a feature about the first one somewhere this week.

Friday it's time for some R&R at [Brightlive](http://www.brightlive.nl/). It looks fun and nice, everybody I know from web stuff is coming and the entrance fee is quite affordable. So join the fun!

This week is also the week of Nokia Live in Amsterdam. Go there if you can. If you can't you can read the reports at Jyri Engeström's blog: [1](http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2006/11/nokia_world_cto.html), [2](http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2006/11/nokia_world_yah.html), [3](http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2006/11/nokia_world_opk.html).
