Things are a bit slow in Amsterdam, this being high summer. Having [Foursquare](http://playfoursquare.com/) (see [previous post](/dingen/2009/07/four-square-or-can-you-smell-the-beer-already/)) and being able to drink some beers in the city now and then does make it a lot more relaxed.

Robert Gaal and I initiated the launch in Amsterdam and it looks like it is really taking off right now. Dutch daily [NRC.next wrote](http://www.nrcnext.nl/blog/2009/08/05/nooit-meer-anoniem-een-biertje-drinken/) a two page spread on the site and quoted me and some others in it. Normally I don't bother with papers, but I went to our neighborhood store and bought a copy:

It's a nice balanced overview piece of the service and the trends towards more ubicomp in your nightlife experience. The big question is, these guys have delivered, will anybody else match them in the foreseeable future?

Local social network [Hyves](http://www.hyves.nl) is bluffing they will introduce similar functionality but it begs the question why they didn't already? I've seen this concept come by in briefings more times than I care to count and nobody has been able to get the buy-in and pull off the experience.
And when was the last update of the Hyves iPhone App? Or of the Facebook App for that matter?

In other news: There was some drama recently with people from outside of Amsterdam adding venues outside of Amsterdam and getting [rebuked](http://twitter.com/robertgaal/status/3120996042) by some people within AMS.

Foursquare's policy is that anybody who wants to play in whatever fashion should be allowed to do so. The data generated can always be filtered better later on using better algorithms and more insight. Just think twice about friending me if you plan on checking in outside of Amsterdam.
