At the end of 2015 personal and professional changes made it clear to us that we would [not continue Hubbub in its current form](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2016/01/engaging-sleep-mode/). That realization made me reorient myself in Berlin and refocus on my core skills as an engineer.

I set myself the goal to work on a significant product as part of a larger team. I thought it would be useful to change up my professional life which thusfar had consisted only of freelance and client work. A long story short, as of this week I'm employed as a software engineer at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/).
