Complaining about the Cloud has become fashionable and it's an easy thing to do. What's not so easy is to create strategic room to maneuver.

I enjoyed these pieces by Will Kelly in part also because they are very glib. They connect because they contain a kernel of truth. The real way to get out of the cloud is indeed: “Real ops maturity. Procurement leverage. The discipline to say “no” to vendor convenience.” That's the real work for anybody who's interested in doing it.
