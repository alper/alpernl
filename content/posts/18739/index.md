I've gone similarly deep on [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com) more than a year ago as one of the candidate technologies (along with [Leptos](https://leptos.dev), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Gleam](https://gleam.run)) for the long awaited new frontend for Cuppings.

I can agree that even though it does not immediately spark joy, it is one of the best candidates for an end-to-end Rust development stack.
