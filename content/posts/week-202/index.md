A different format for these weeknotes:

### In meetings

Met with the guys from Amstel Media and had a chat over at [Sanoma Media](http://www.sanomamedia.com/). Met up with [Ton Zijlstra](http://www.zylstra.org/blog/) after way too long and [Henk Jan Bouwmeester](http://www.hetgelaat.nl/).

### In work

Project Statlas made solid progress on both the renderer and the interaction framework. The map is looking pretty spanking on [Polymaps](http://polymaps.org/), but no screenshots yet.

For Maguro I modelled the entire game in the database and made a beat scheduler using [celery](http://celeryproject.org/). Using that I created a fully playable prototype.

### In writing

Wrote about how the process of government contracting ICT projects could be made more transparent in Dutch: [“Transparantie in ICT-aanbestedingen”](/dingen/2011/01/transparantie-in-ict-aanbestedingen/)

### In events

We [announced](https://twitter.com/alper/status/29592686222647296) the next [Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/) for March 12th. Then we started scouting locations and drafting the program for that event. It's looking good!

I was at the [VPRO](http://www.vpro.nl) launch of their iPad documentary and I got an advance copy to play with. Together with Iskander [we coined](https://twitter.com/#!/alper/status/29932287252504577) the term Sensor Parkour: _“in an ubicomp surveillance world, ‘sensor parkour’ could become a novel situationist exercise.”_ [![Good gear is good](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5218/5391313500_845e15e70a.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/5391313500/ "Good gear is good by illustir, on Flickr")

Then I went to another event about the end of the publishing industry. Funnily enough most book publishers in the Netherlands have no clue about the consequences the internet is going to have for their business.

Friday we had [impromptu drinks](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=102630169815052) at [@ouroffice](http://twitter.com/ouroffice) along with an attempt to hack the OV-chipkaart which was a lot of fun and got a bunch of people to come out. Expect more of that and probably also a dataviz ignite somewhere in April.
