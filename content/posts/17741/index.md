Seeing if I can move from [Arc](https://thebrowser.company) to [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) but there are half a dozen radical improvements in Arc that \*make\* the experience. It just shows how much innovation and solid thinking was packed in all of that frivolous design.

Vivaldi on the other hand has a million settings which mostly show that nobody knows wat this app is supposed to be doing. There are entire note taking apps and e-mail clients in there but none of them fun or nice to use.

Products truly live and die in the pixels.
