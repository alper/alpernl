A bunch of stuff I did last week is summarized nicely at [the Hubbub weeknotes](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2013/02/week-182/). This is going to happen more and more often, so these weeknotes may become at risk. We'll see what happens.

Anyway, I tried to dial into a conference call while there was a massive demonstration happening over at Wienerstraße #Lausitzer8. Having the riot police and the anarchists play tag below your window creates something of a racket:

This corner of Kreuzberg is becoming more and more interesting and I'm running into people randomly in various lunch places. Last week I had the pleasure to meet both [Chris Eidhof](http://eidhof.nl/) (who we should see more of in this part of town) and [Jannis Leidel](http://jannisleidel.com/).

Niels posted [the second Recess!](http://nielsthooft.com/recess-2-second-country) which was as awesome as I'd expected it to be.

On Thursday I went to the TPB AFK screening in c-base which was organized by [Michelle Thorne](http://michellethorne.cc/) after a conversation in a cafe here. I look forward to meeting lots more interesting people around the area and conspiring to do awesome things with them.

I [wrote up the watersnake app](/dingen/2013/02/watersnake-a-simple-voting-app/) I wrote over here. Expect to see us meddle more into these kind of systems from a game design point of view.

And on the weekend I played two new board games (Cosmic Encounter and King of Tokyo) and had dinner with [Tim de Gier](http://timdegier.nl/) and [the Dekker brothers](http://gidsy.com/).
