You can plan this entire thing very dynamically. I don't even think you need to book anything really far in advance given how empty everything is.

Bring your hiking sticks. I'm regretting not bringing mine. It would really have added some tempo to my walk and saved my knees. Don't forget the pavement dampers for the road walking segments.
