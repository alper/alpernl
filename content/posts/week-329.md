Most of the time this week was spent doing heads down work ( [notes on which elsewhere](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/category/weeknotes/)). Meeting with [Igor](https://twitter.com/zeigor) and [Tijmen](https://twitter.com/TijmenR) and hanging out in parks. Summer.

That week I went to the Liepnitzsee for a swim. The key to surviving the summer in Berlin is to get out of the city and usually coincide that wit a trip to one of the many many lakes. Most of these are just bedding of the Havel/Spree/Oder passing through so they are not very deep or cool, but the Liepnitzsee is an exception and may be one of the best distance/quality lakes in the area.

With global warming happening here with a vengeance water temperatures are on the rise as well. Most of the not so deep lakes are approaching 28C already and there's no telling where stuff will end up next week or in a couple of years. So even though it may be to early, I'm already worrying about [the brain eating amoeba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naegleria_fowleri).

After that it was off to [Betapitch](http://www.betapitch.de/) to hangout with friends and to see startups present. What was painfully obvious in most of the presentations was that none of the startups had [a serious unfair advantage](http://www.forbes.com/sites/venkateshrao/2012/09/03/entrepreneurs-are-the-new-labor-part-ii-2/3/) other than their presumed grit.
