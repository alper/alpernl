This week was a bit more stationary than the last thankfully. I tried out a competitor to [Cuppings](http://cuppin.gs) called Bean Seeker which is a rather terrible app.

That night I attended the IoT Berlin meetup organized by Martin and had dinner with a rather interesting set of people.

I also started playing [DOTA2](http://blog.dota2.com/) this week for which there is a working Mac client available and which is a deep but somewhat too hardcore experience.

Cuppings was featured on [Fontanel](http://notes.fontanel.nl/post/56859920394/cuppings) and we got a [mention from London's Best Coffee](https://twitter.com/coffeelondon/status/362585600571875329). Both of those are from people we respect which makes it mean the world to us. It also made us hit top 3 in the Food and Drink category of the Dutch store, which is nice to see (and altogether too easy).

I met Will Perkins and [Nikos Green](http://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/arbeitsbereiche/emotionspsych/mitarbeiter/post-docs/green/index.html) both highly capable people who I look forward to work with (again).

I [read up about SpriteKit](https://devforums.apple.com/message/824501#824501) which is in the forthcoming iOS7 release and should make 2D game programming very very easy for developers. Looking forward a lot to iOS becoming an even more capable platform than it is.

On Friday we tried to attend the inaugural Biteclub which turned out to be too busy if you actually want to eat something.

That Saturday I started to work on the AJI prototype in earnest which is coming together nicely as we speak.
