This week started pretty extreme ((Thoug we wouldn't have it any other way. It was epic!)) with 12+ hour days on Monday and Tuesday culminating in the launch of [PLAY Pilots](http://playpilots.nl/).

Wednesday was occupied with fallout, rest and coming to terms with [Stumptown Amsterdam's](http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/going-dutch-stumptown-coffee-in-amsterdam/) closing. I drank quite some coffee there and talked lots of work. Also Martijn dropped by the office to solder something:

Thursday started the quest to find a good identity for [Monster Swell](http://monsterswell.com). Also started the foray into the Dutch subsidy jungle.

Friday, updated the [portfolio's](http://aardverschuiving.com/portfolio) [a bit](http://monsterswell.com/) and went to the (OMG WTF) MoMo AMS BBQ.

Saturday my [Epson V500](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VG4AY0?ie=UTF8&tag=alpercugun-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000VG4AY0) scanner arrived which I'll be using mostly for capturing project documentation better and scanning [120 film](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/tags/120/). On to an even more dematerialized life.

Sunday was occupied with a lot of reading in [Designing for the Digital Age](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470229101?ie=UTF8&tag=alpercugun-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470229101) preparing for the [UX Book Club](http://www.linkedin.com/osview/canvas?_ch_page_id=1&_ch_panel_id=1&_ch_app_id=30&_applicationId=2000&appParams={%22referrer%22:%22hub%22,%22go_to%22:%22events/353536%22}&_ownerId=1580980&completeUrlHash=wyjd) we are hosting on Tuesday. Also more scanning (and throwing out paper) and writing the first issue of my Dutch design and technology column “Design Directie”(due out here tomorrow morning).
