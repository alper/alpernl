The ever great combination of [a randomly crashing Macbook](http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/) and Textmate has caused me to lose all of my writing of yesterday. It wasn't that much, nor was it that brilliant, but it was something I would have liked to hang on to.

I probably forgot to save, but for some strange reason Textmate does not catch my Command-S keypresses (which makes saving a bitch).
