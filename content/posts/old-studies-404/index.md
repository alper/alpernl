I have a big list of light reading, idea-heavy non-fiction which sort of fits in with my Masters project and with today's payday I thought I would splash out on a bit.

One book I wanted —[“Naked Conversations”](http://laughingsquid.com/2006/02/18/naked-conversations-techcrunch-party-photos/) by [Robert Scoble](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/) and Shel Israel— was not available in all of the web shops I investigated and was ridiculously expensive at [ABC](http://www.abc.nl) at €29. After some clicking around I found out that shipping it from [Amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk) would only net me a slightly lower price than at ABC with the 10% student discount. I'll pick it up in the Hague one of these days.

You might recall the Scoble Israel clip from [a recent Rocketboom episode](http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/02/rb_06_feb_23.html).

I also had a gift certificate from Bol.com lying around so the splashing out did not really have that much financial consequences. What I did get:

- Seth Godin — [“Permission Marketing”](http://www.sethgodin.com/permission/)

- Malcolm Gladwell — [“The Tipping Point”](http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/index.html)

- Paul Arden — It's not how good you are, it's how good you want to be

- Jonathan Safran Foer — [“Everything is Illuminated”](http://www.jonathansafranfoerbooks.com/about.html)

I'm especially looking forward to the Gladwell book.
