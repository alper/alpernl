I'm reading a lot about sociality and online possibilities lately. Reading articles, blogposts, watching and listening to presentations and just about anything I can get my hands on.

I have to say this is just about as exciting a field of study as I could wish for.

One person I'd like to highlight is [Jyri Engströ](http://www.zengestrom.com/) ([wiki](/wiki/index.php/Literature_List#Engestr.C3.B6m.2C_Jyri)) and [his talk at reboot](http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/06/speaking_on_obj.html) about Object Sociality. It's great stuff.

I also came across the book *“In the Bubble; Designing in a complex world”* by John Thackara ([wiki](/wiki/index.php/Literature_List#Thackara.2C_John)) who is currently located in Amsterdam. Today I listened to [the ITConversation with him](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail591.html)[[1]](#[1]) in it. That was pretty interesting and gave me a couple of ideas.

I then went to the website of the company he works for: Doors of Perception. On the blog there it says he is [giving a talk tomorrow evening in Amsterdam](http://www.doorsofperception.com/archives/2005/09/upcoming_talk_i.php). This is a great coincidence because I'm going to be in Amsterdam tomorrow to pick up my plain ticket anyway.

[1] I love [ITConversations](http://www.itconversations.com)! They have some of the best people in the industry talking about what makes the world of technology tick at the moment.
