By default Flash is turned off in my browser. The [FlashBlock extension](http://flashblock.mozdev.org/) takes care of that.

That is why I was surprised to see a very [dynamic Rijksmuseum homepage](http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/index.jsp). I thought it was some Flash that had slipped by my blocker. It is not. This is what is possible by JavaScript in the browser currently and this is only the beginning.

The only shame is that the pages do not degrade gracefully if you turn off scripting in your browser.
