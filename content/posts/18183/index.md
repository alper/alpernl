We have kids in two parallel classes at school which lets us compare things directly and gives us insights many of the other parents don't have.

One class was doing great and the other one was struggling, this also made the parents of that class become frustrated and non-constructive. I'm in two Whatsapp groups and can compare the vibe and noise level of both directly.

Then the class that was struggling got a clinch new staff member and the class that was doing well's teachers got disbanded and the atmosphere among the parents changed night and day. Now the parents who were chill are creating way more noise and the other parents are much more constructive and relaxed.

I'll take this as a leadership lesson: No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders
