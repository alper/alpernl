After reading about it, I started trying out Sonshi style myself. RMS is a disgusting character so let’s just pretend the guru is somebody else.

I do this during extended work sessions away from my desk.

The setup is really easy with Karabiner Elements and a new profile that disables the laptop built-in keyboard when my contra is plugged in.
