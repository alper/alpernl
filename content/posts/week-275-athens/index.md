The week before last I spent in Athens mostly hanging out, going to the beach and getting some work done.

That was also the week that I upgraded my Things client to to [the Things Cloud Beta](http://culturedcode.com/beta/thingscloud/download/). I think I'm not supposed to say anything about it, but let me just say: ++. I have started moving large parts of my workload to [Asana](http://www.asana.com/), so it remains to be seen if native apps like these continue to be a good fit for what is an inherently collaborative effort.

In Athens I crashed the local hackers event at [the Colab Workspace Athens](https://foursquare.com/v/colab-workspace-athens/4cd8072251fc8cfae42fe75d) where the Ruby group were discussing the organization of the next Euroku. And another day I found [the O.M.G. event](http://www.team-refuse.org/content/News/Team_Refuse_invited_to_OMG_event-36.html), short for Overclocking, Modding and Gaming where lots of people gathered to play Call of Duty 4.

I wrote up [a longer report of my experiences in Greece](/dingen/2012/06/greece-a-society-undergoing-stockholm-syndrome/) last week.
