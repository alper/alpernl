I gave the presentation for the [TOPdesk](http://www.topdesk.com) consultants today. Keynote [did not crash](http://alper.nl/blog/tech/169) my Macbook once and the presentation was well received, it is in Dutch and you can find it [here](http://alper.nl/media/TOPwiki.pdf).

I *am* absolutely in love with my Macbook remote which also serves as a slide advancer for Keynote. Absolutely brilliant. I could walk around the reasonably big room and advance my slides with the remote from just about anywhere.

The room was packed and it started to feel like a sauna near the end but the reception of the presentation was uniformly positive. The content had some bitter pills which some people found hard to swallow. Overal the presentation was a succes, it got tongues talking and grew interest in the wiki.
