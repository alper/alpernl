The news that an OSINT researcher spent 30 minutes to find a fugitive that the German police couldn't find in the past 30 years says a lot about how government works here.

Most likely the police would say that they couldn't use any modern tools or data sources here because of _Datenschutz_ (data protection) reasons. Datenschutz is 1. a great excuse for people who don't want to do their jobs and 2. a way to protect every kind of crook and criminal.
