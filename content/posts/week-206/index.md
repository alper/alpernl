Monday as a fixture was the third session of my course over at WdeKA concerning itself with the basics of information and visualisation design.

The rest of the week was spent working on _hermosillo_ and _maguro_. The first was launched as [http://www.pvda-altijdindebuurt.nl](http://www.pvda-altijdindebuurt.nl/) just before the elections of yesterday as the first version of an electoral monitoring platform. A full write-up on which is forthcoming at [Monster Swell](http://www.monsterswell.com).

Then with everything done it was off to Berlin with partners in crime Kars Alfrink and Alexander Zeh for a weekend of [Cognitive Cities](http://cognitivecities.com/) and leveling up our skills at that particular city. The conference was ace as was the weekend.
