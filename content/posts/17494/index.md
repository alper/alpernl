I haven't tried it out yet but seeing the collaboration features in Zed described here, that sounds pretty much like my ideal workflow.

Chat channels including voice and screen sharing integrated directly into a lightning fast editor enabling seamless collaboration and visibility on who are doing something together. Unscheduled calls instead of endless calendar invites that don't fit the shape of the work anyway.
