I grabbed [the code](https://github.com/alper/goodreadsgraph) I had lying around for [last year](/dingen/2017/12/reading-2017/) and without too much trouble ran the same analysis for the books. The graph is not that dramatic this time though for some reason I did not read much during summer.

{{< figure src="/dingen/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/download.png" alt="" caption="" >}}

Page-wise this year with 13398 pages was a bit weaker than last year (15049 pages).

By some miracle, I managed to post my top ten recommendations to twitter on the 31st.

Now as to the categories in which I read books and what I thought stood out.

### **Leadership**

Not as many books as last year, but some very good ones and an area where I will read more. Rumelt has written one of the best books on strategy I’ve seen. Marquet’s highly recommended book I think will bear fruit on future re-reading. Scott’s book contains a fairly complete operating system for a modern tech company.

The cracking books are ok and did helped me crack a PM interview but still had nothing to do with the job I started working at last month.

- **Good Strategy / Bad Strategy, Richard Rumelt**
- **Turn the Ship Around, David Marquet**
- **Radical Candor, Kim Malone Scott**
- Cracking the Tech Career
- The First 90 Days
- Cracking the PM Interview

_Diversity (non-white/non-male): 3/6_

I don’t have an **Engineering** category this year (I abandoned [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and consulted but did not finish [the App Architecture book](https://www.objc.io/books/app-architecture/)). I am reading topical things for my new job so this year will be better.

### **Non-Fiction**

I’m pleasantly surprised how much I’ve managed to read. Mishra’s book is one of the few really mainstream non-white perspectives on a very important part of our history and I keep enjoying seeing him take names in the [LRB](https://www.lrb.co.uk/) and [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/international). Bluets is a beautiful introspective trip just like The Argonauts was. Sandifer is a critical tour de force of with an ideology and temperament I don’t see anywhere else. I’ve always been fond of Machiavelli but with Erica Benner’s rehabilitation of him I don’t have to be embarrassed about that anymore. Runciman’s book about the alternatives to democracy is like a protracted and focused episode of the podcast.

I don’t have a Fiction category or Sapiens would be there instead of here.

- **From the Ruins of Empire, Pankaj Mishra**
- Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari
- Ecology without Nature, Timothy Morton
- A Contest of Ideas, Nelson Lichtenstein
- **Bluets, Maggie Nelson**
- **Neoreaction a Basilisk, Elizabeth Sandifer**
- No Name in the Street, James Baldwin
- Why We Sleep, Matthew Walker
- **Be Like the Fox, Erica Benner**
- The Chapo Guide to Revolution
- The Hall of Uselessness, Simon Leys
- Surveillance Valley, Yasha Levine
- **How Democracy Ends, David Runciman**

_Diversity (non-white/non-male): 5/13_

### **Genre Fiction**

I have been very light on genre fiction and I’m not sure whether SF will continue to be a thing I read much of in the future. The genre is bigger than ever but there is so little serious stuff coming out.

I am glad to have re-read Le Guin this year. Majestic.

- Akata Witch, Nnedi Okorafor
- Altered Carbon, Richard Morgan
- The Fifth Season, N.K. Jemisin
- The Obelisk Gate, N.K. Jemisin
- The Stone Sky, N.K. Jemisin
- Broken Angels, Richard Morgan
- Woken Furies, Richard Morgan
- The Planet on the Table, Kim Stanley Robinson
- **The Left Hand of Darkness, Ursula Le Guin**

_Diversity (non-white/non-male): 5/9_

### **Literature**

I find it easier to read non-fiction because I can’t parallelize literature very well and whenever I read a dud (here’s looking at you Elif) they block the queue for everything else. Makumbi’s Ugandan family saga has opened up my perspective on the country like a good local novel can do. Hamid’s rumination on refugees is short and sharp like a blade. Shanbhag’s book is a quick family tale of rags to riches where everything becomes entangled.

- Terug naar Oegstgeest, Jan Wolkers
- **Kintu, Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi**
- Dorsvloer vol confetti, Franca Treur
- Voyage to the End of the Night, Louis-Ferdinand Céline
- **Exit West, Mohsin Hamid**
- **Ghachar Ghochar, Vivek Shanbhag**
- The Idiot, Elif Batuman

### **Kids**

I read so many (34!) kids books this year and this number will probably only increase since we have only just started visiting the library. We live close to the [Amerika Gedenkbibilothek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek) which has a fairly sized kids department.

Franchises that did well with us this year were Kikker and the newly discovered Pip & Posy. We finished the seasonal Wimmelbücher (of which Fall was the highlight and Winter a disappointment). Let’s see whether these see renewed play next year.

The kids books do inflate my reading number a lot but that is _not_ taking into account that I have had to read most of these books dozens of times. So there’s that.

- So Müde und Hellwach
- Welcher Po passt auf dieses Klo?
- Mama kwijt
- De dieren van Fiep
- Kikker en Eend
- **Kikker is jarig, Max Velthuijs**
- Was willst du Baby?
- Piep piep met Fiep
- Brown Bear, Brown Bear
- So leicht so schwer
- Der kleine Hase
- Das kleine Lamm
- Badetag für Hasekind
- Sommer-Wimmelbuch
- Frühlings-Wimmelbuch
- Kaatje zegt nee
- **Pip en Posy en het nieuwe vriendje, Axel Scheffler**
- Das kleine Schwein
- The Pony Twins
- Sommer
- Het vrolijke voorleesboek van Kikker
- Winter-Wimmelbuch
- Beestje, kom je op mijn feestje?
- Hörst du die klassische Musik?
- Het carnaval der dieren
- Ssst! De tijger slaapt
- Ik zou wel een kindje lusten
- No Bad Kids
- Oh Crap! Potty Training
- Ein kleines Krokodil mit ziemlich viel Gefühl
- Pip en Posy en de kerstboom
- **Herbst-Wimmelbuch, Rotraut Susanne Berner**
- Aki und Kon, der Fuchs

### **Spirituality**

Two solid books on this slow but steady path.

- The Parent’s Tao te Ching
- Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior
