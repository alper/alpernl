The corollary to this is that in any field where there is a gender disparity, the surplus of people is subcompetent.

Let's take software engineering as an example.

If we assume that programming ability is distributed equally between men and women--and there's really nothing pointing in a different direction here-- then it follows that if there are 80% men and 20% men in the field, then those 30% men are taking up the spots of women who would have been better at this work.

Ceteris paribus of course, which it isn't for all kinds of similarly gender equity related reasons.

And to go one further, the incompetent men in the field know they're incompetent. That's why they try to keep women out and are often nasty to work with.
