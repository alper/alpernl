I've kind of started my Masters project at [TOPdesk](http://www.topdesk.nl) implementing social sofware for them and the meme is spreading around the office.

Tangentially related I shouted out the idea to install a [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org/) server internally for our communication. Niels picked it up immediately and installed [Wildfire](http://www.jivesoftware.org/wildfire/) on a virtual server he had lying around.

Wildfire install with LDAP authentication was a breeze as far as I could tell (I wasn't there most of the time). The [Spark client](http://www.jivesoftware.com/products/spark/) they provide is pretty solid but cool people of course use either [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/) or [Gaim](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/) to connect.

The interesting bit was *how* fast it caught on. It only took one company wide e-mail with basic instructions and the location of the Spark installer to get everybody online like —exactly— wildfire.

Everyone from our nerds to our most non-tech savvy employees got online and started chatting and putting their creativity into making fun buddy icons to display their identity.

Not all is lost. I have proof that work was done because some people had also discovered the custom status message and put themselves on “Away - Aan het werk”.
