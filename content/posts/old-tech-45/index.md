I am **this** close to throwing the steaming piece of shit browser Safari out of the window. I would have long ago, but it is so damn sexy.

You know she's bad for you, but you just keep coming back.

I had three or four Safari crashes today. *“Safari crashed unexpectedly”*. Yeah, it's always when you least expect it, just like the Spanish Inquisition.

And then it asks if I want to Reopen it. Yeah, I want to Reopen it, **with al the bleedin' tabs I had open when the [damn piece of shit](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/) crashed!**

Sorry, had to get that off my chest.
