Just handed in my registrations for both [XTECH](http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/) and [Reboot](http://reboot.dk/) to Marleen here at [TOPdesk](http://www.topdesk.nl). Both should come through fine and send me happily off for some conference fun in May and June.

XTECH looks great this year. I think the [topics](http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/schedule) are more interesting than last year and the list of speakers they have lined up is simply incredible. My list of heroes who I am looking forward to see:

- [David Baron](http://dbaron.org/)

- [Tom Coates](http://www.plasticbag.org/)

- [Miguel de Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/)

- [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/)

- [Ryan King](http://theryanking.com/blog/)

- [Håkon Lie](http://people.opera.com/howcome/)

- [Simon Willison](http://simon.incutio.com/)

- Brendan Eich

- [Alex Russell](http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/)

And after XTECH [Barcamp Amsterdam II](http://barcamp.org/BarCampAmsterdamII) starts off.

And I heard so much good stuff about Reboot last year and read some [blogs](http://novemberborn.net/reboot8/attending) [of](http://blog.leapfrog.nl/archives/2006/03/27/reboot-8-announced/) [people](http://www.zylstra.org/blog/archives/2006/03/it_must_be_spri.html) who are going again this year. It looks fun and I could use a weekend off in beautiful Copenhagen.

You coming?
