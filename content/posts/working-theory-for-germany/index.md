I have been in Berlin for a couple of hectic days now and I'm trying to come to terms with my surroundings. I have got a new working theory to use for the foreseeable future. Let's see how well this holds up:

> Germany has not quite recovered from their catastrophical experiment with modernism in the ’30s-’40s. This caused them to fall back and get stuck in a sort of classical romanticism. This stuckness has caused them to skip post-modernism and the developments that came after and is the main reason why its cultural velocity is slow. Some individuals have modernized to a greater or lesser extent and the developments of ’68 have had an effect, but the institutional parts of the country remain firmly entrenched in the past.

As I said, I'm new here and this is two days' worth of rumination thinly sliced. Comments for amending it are very welcome.
