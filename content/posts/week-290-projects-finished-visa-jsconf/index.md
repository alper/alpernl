Brief weeknotes for last week: closed off [Pig Chase](http://playingwithpigs.nl/) with the prototype test in the stables. I got to start building a playable prototype for sake, more on that later.

A large part of the rest of the week I spent in various states of bureaucracy trying to get everything in order to be able to request a visa for China. I think I've spent about as much time getting the requested papers as I will be in Beijing proper.

During the off hours of this week I started a small project to check the Dutch laws into github over at [Staten Generaal](https://github.com/statengeneraal/) ( [write-up](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/alle-nederlandse-wetten-in-github/)).

Some nice responses to that:

But the real work has only just begun and we need to figure where the project should actually go to.

The Beestenbende project page went online, an iPhone game I coded: http://whatsthehubbub.nl/projects/beestenbende/

And I got added to [the Praxis Berlin website](http://praxisberlin.net/) which is the web presence of my current studio.

And I spent quite a bit of the weekend at the [JSConf](http://2012.jsconf.eu/) parties. It was fun to meet lots of people I hadn't seen in quite a while and the conference was quite excellently organized.
