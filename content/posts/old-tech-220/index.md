I'm moulding some of my ideas of recent and not too recent into a deck titled **“Social Networks as Online Panacea”**.

It goes on about how most of the problems of identity and trust we are faced with currently can be solved using online social networks and then delves deeper into some of the issues.

It looks like it could be an interesting presentation and way above the level of a lot of what I've seen in the last week (nay! last year).  But where should I give it?
