I promised to write an update to [the Heist Model](/dingen/2010/09/not-hiring-anybody/) a long time ago and never got around to it because of work and other stuff. Then recently conversations with friends moving back into the freelance life prompted this smaller update but it too had been languishing in a draft for far too long.

So now I'm resolving to get this out as a multi blogpost thing over the course of the coming week.

As a disclaimer, we at [Hubbub](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/) are not working exactly like the model proposed above anymore. This is in part because the focus of our business has shifted towards consulting, but for any serious production work we do still work like that.

We have incorporated and thought up some innovative ways to structure the business within the Dutch/German framework we live in. I'll come back to that later.

We have also seen too many of our friends change their businesses or suspend their operations to prompt serious reflection on our part. That reflection is ongoing but the way we are organized contributes to our optimistic view of the future.

The Heist Model was meant to be a way for sole proprietors to work together and to think bigger. I think those things are still necessary. During the next days we'll first treat the standard options that are open to freelancers and why they don't really fit before we dive into an alternative way of doing things.
