I just went to see [“The Coming Storm”](http://www.festival-avignon.com/en/Spectacle/3364) at the Festival d'Avignon. In an interesting open setup, bits and pieces of stories are performed by the ensemble who continually interrupt each other. While one actor is telling a story the others perform variety like diversions using props, music and each other.

The stories initially do carry some novelty and absurdity and are performed adequately. After a while unfortunately they become repetitious and there isn't a lot funny about them (though the easily excitable French audience seemed to disagree). Half an hour before the end I concluded that this was the tritest thing I'd seen on stage in years without any hope for salvation. That was €22 and an hour of free time wasted.
