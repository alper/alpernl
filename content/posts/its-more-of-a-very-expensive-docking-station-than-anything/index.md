What [Ben Hammersley uses](http://ben.hammersley.usesthis.com/) (besides [the travel drug](http://benhammersley.com/post/718362399/better-out-than-in)):

> I had an epiphany about 8 years ago, when my home office went from having 4 big tower PCs in various states of repair and OS, along with my own servers and NAS and lots of cable runs and so on, to a single [iBook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook "Apple's old consumer laptop.") running off WiFi.

Same here. I had this futile attempt at running Linux on the desktop which was a perpetual cause of pain and frustration. I still love that first 12" iBook that saved me from it all.

Now to get that iPad (I am a total [InstaPaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) fiend).
