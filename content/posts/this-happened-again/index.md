Monday I'll be attending [This Happened Utrecht #2](http://thishappened.nl/) ((I think it's fully booked, so better luck next time. See the [video's of #1](http://www.vimeo.com/thutrecht) on Vimeo.)). This Happened is organized by Ianus, Alex and Kars as part of the [This Happened franchise](http://www.thishappened.org/) and the best description I've heard is that “it's like [Pecha Kucha](http://www.pecha-kucha.org/) with actual content.”

The [presentations](http://leapfrog.nl/blog/archives/2009/01/30/the-2nd-dutch-this-happened-is-coming-this-way/) promise to be interesting again, it'll be nice to catch up with people and I'll be writing a blog report of the Q&A sessions ((And no, I will not be turning problogger.)). So it would be nice if people would ask questions worth blogging and worth talking about after the event. I'm pretty sure comments will be open.

### MIMOA

Of [the people presenting](http://www.mimoa.eu/blog/?p=522) I'd already heard about [MIMOA](http://www.mimoa.eu/). I'm pretty interested in architecture ((I'm one of those people who has to live in the built environment.)) and I gave the site a brief test run.

It's a great open catalogue (or [is it a personal architectural guide](http://www.mimoa.eu/what_is_mimoa/)?). It's mostly functional and I saw that they also syndicate their content to for instance the [Stylos](http://www.stylos.nl/) ((the architectural student association)) site. Some of the flows and layouts of the site are a bit jarring and could use fixing but they don't detract from the core usefulness of the site ((In a brief [chat with Kie Ellens](/dingen/2009/02/art-in-the-public-space/) he also remarked that there is far too little architectural material semi-freely available online. Which is —I would add— backward and detrimental to the profession.)).

The only thing I'm curious about is whether MIMOA could be used as a tool to bridge the gap between architecture professionals and us naieve end users (or should I say victims) of their creations. The current blurbs and comment system do not really invite to such.
