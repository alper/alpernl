A piece about real-world Rust development that struck a cord with many people. Most of the issues listed here are valid and longstanding to the point that you have to wonder if they'll ever be fixed.

I have a similar feeling around Rust web development where for all the good building blocks it doesn't really seem to get off the ground. At the same time Go has been going really hard for ages. Maybe spending all your time to get the types to line up doesn't leave room for building?
