Last Tuesday I gave a talk at EMERCE [Tech Live](https://tech-live.nl/?utm_source=Emerce&utm_medium=Mail&utm_content=lanceermail&utm_campaign=techlive17%2F) on the main stage of the Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam. It was a lovely event and it was fun being back in Amsterdam however briefly.

It was a business focussed practical riff on my ‘Designing Conversational Interfaces’ talk that may have blown some people's minds. So it goes!
