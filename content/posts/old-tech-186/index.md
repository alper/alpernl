Apple [finally responds](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304308) to the problems of Macbooks shutting down [[via](http://www.webwereld.nl/ref/rss/42812)]. Why did this have to take so long?

If you are the owner of a Macbook that shuts down randomly a couple of times a day, I cannot begin to imagine the irritation and anguish that would cause you.

Assuming a [posture of moral superiority](http://www.apple.com/getamac/) is one thing, living up to it is a whole different story.
