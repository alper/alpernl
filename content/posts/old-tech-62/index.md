What!? First Flickr and now [Yahoo! buys del.icio.us as well](http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html)? It pretty much comes down to all my favorite sites being bought by them.

And what does Google do in the midst of this acquisition frenzy? Bring out more half baked products…

I'm having serious loyalty doubts.
