There was a Delft-wide power outage this afternoon at around noon. This is the reason my server at home went down (and took this blog with it). It *was* fun to see everybody around me get up in frustration while I could keep on typing on my Macbook's ‘UPS’.

A liberalized energy market is great fun all in all. Electricity which was already very cheap and very reliable is going to be made even more cheap and reliable by handing it over to market forces, or so the free market evangelists tell us.

What they don't tell us is how they lined their pockets in the process and will be long gone when we are left with the shattered remains. And good luck getting a financial restitution for today's lack of service, either sole or class action.

Added note: This did not make the news today. Makes you wonder how often this happens throughout the Netherlands without anybody knowing.
