Back when I read this exposé in November it struck me as gripping but also as something that could become messy. Turns out that's true since the piece now has the mark "Censored" and some choice parts of text have been blanked out. I did a quick search but can't find any updates what might have happened. If I find time later, I'll look in the Wayback Machine to see what pieces of text disappeared.

The kind of property deals that are described in the article are par for the course in any up and coming city. Recently there was a piece about resistance to the city giving away one of its largest buildings to a private art gallery: https://www.freitag.de/autoren/der-freitag/portraet-wut-motiviert-mich

The academic backroom dealings should also be considered to be normal especially in small subfields such as Turkey studies. Academics are playing funding games more than they research and the web of foundations that float around are ways to creatively bookkeep and move money around. None of this is really surprising.
