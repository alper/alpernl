[Apps voor Nederland](http://appsvoornederland.nl) continues apace as it keeps on doing.

Talks about open data and data journalism are ongoing at a number of Dutch parties. After last year's attention, it seems that this year various parties are indeed getting serious about it.

Then I went to a talk by [Michael LaFond](http://id22.net/) at [ARCAM](http://www.arcam.nl) in Amsterdam about the Berlin co-housing movement that he started in part ((For some reason many of the new thing happening in Berlin seem to be started by non-locals, but maybe that's a normal thing everyweher.)). All the more interesting because I am moving to Berlin in January of next year and we're already registered at several projects on [Wohnportal Berlin](http://www.wohnportal-berlin.de/), the site he setup. Several of the projects he showed during the evening also have our attention as prospective Berlin living space. My notes for the evening and a more elaborate write-up of the Q&A are [up on this blog](/dingen/2011/10/michael-lafond-berlin-co-housing/).

I built a next iteration for _guadalupe_ that is indeed becoming more playable as we speak. I am very eager to invite more people to that play experience sometime soon.

Wednesday we announced the first speaker for [Code Camping Amsterdam](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/2011/10/code-camping-amsterdam/): [Matt Biddulph](http://www.hackdiary.com/). We're really excited to have Matt come over to Amsterdam again.

Went to [Booreiland](http://booreiland.nl) to work on _culiacan_.

At long last I [posted the pictures](/dingen/2011/10/geeks-of-ouroffice/) I took of people visiting our office with my Yashica medium format camera.

My review of [The Binding of Isaac](http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/) was published in [nrc.next](http://www.nrcnext.nl/).

Sunday we had a marathon meeting for the constitution of the merged foundation that is going to be the greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts [Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/) and [Het Nieuwe Stemmen](http://www.hetnieuwestemmen.nl/). I am very excited for the potential of the new organization.
