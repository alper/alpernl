I've got a brand new toy and I'm very busy playing with it. Getting the hang of Mac OS X's applications, shortcuts and idiosyncracies is going to take me a while, but it is a lot of fun.

One thing I already know for sure. Apple is so far ahead of the game of both Windows and Linux as far as usable desktops and *it just works* go. In no time I've downloaded, installed and set up Skype, Real Player and MSN Messenger for my use. My computing experience just went up by several orders of magnitude.
