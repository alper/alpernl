Watched “Evil Does Not Exist” as GIFT, the recut and rescored (silent) version performed live by [Eiko Ishibashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiko_Ishibashi) at HAU1.

This has a shorter runtime than the movie because a lot of fluff is cut out and we are only left with a very summary story. That is a good choice and I can't say the movie suffers from it very much even though this is version is very much its own thing (i.e. not a narrative movie).

Ishibashi-san is on stage and directs the musical soundtrack while occasionally accompanying the movie on her flute. From the distance it was very hard to tell what she was doing or even what sounds she was producing on top of the soundtrack.

Musically it's a lot of the soundscapes with the main theme interspersed at various key junctures. We don't get to learn anything more about the ending.
