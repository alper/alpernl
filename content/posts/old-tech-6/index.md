[ITConversations](http://www.itconversations.com) is a great resource for information of computer happenings. They have great interviews with leading figures from all over the industry.

Today I listened to one from [Jason Friedman](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail471.html) about how his company [37 Signals](http://www.37signals.com) developed their web project management application Basecamp.

He tells a great story how they made agile software development techniques work and what you should pay attention to when implementing them in your own project.

Most of it is common sense but it is still valuable insight: keep light, keep smart and keep focused. If you are missing on any of these then you are already wrong.
