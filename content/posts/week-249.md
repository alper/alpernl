In the beginning of the week I spotted an interesting dataset on Sargasso, requested to play with it and got the following [visual published the next day](http://sargasso.nl/archief/2011/12/20/interrupties-tweede-kamer-mooi-verbeeld/) ( [our write-up](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2012/01/parliamentary-interruptions/)).

Then it was off to Berlin to finalize things with the appartment and prepare the move.

My review of [“Where is my Heart?”](http://gutefabrik.com/wimh.html) was also published in the nrc.next that week ( [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/nielsthooft/status/150113469012770816)):

Finally my proposal to present on the [Apps for Amsterdam](http://www.appsforamsterdam.nl/) project on the [Social Cities of Tomorrow](http://www.socialcitiesoftomorrow.nl/) conference was aspected and I will be attending and presenting at that conference in Amsterdam. Data commons are a topic that is very near to our practice and I look forward to exchanging ideas with those attending.
