I just got a random telemarketeer call from an Apple employee in English asking me if I wanted to extend my Apple Care support. It wasn't completely clear if they were calling to extend the Apple Care on my iBook (likely) or the 90 day free phone support on my Macbook.

It took the caller and me a while before I got the gist of the call, and then I had no clue why I would ever use technical phon support. If my Macbook was say experiencing [random shutdowns](http://alper.nl/blog/tech/199), shouldn't I be entitled to free support?

Bad one on Apple to use my permission to harrass me with this kind of crap.
