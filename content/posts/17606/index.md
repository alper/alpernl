Trying for years to explain to people that Germany has almost zero [project power](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-296-project-power-hegemony) and is incapable of any progress and then suddenly [a movement springs up](https://eu-acc.com) that agrees entirely with that assessment.

Not sure if I should be pleased or miffed.
