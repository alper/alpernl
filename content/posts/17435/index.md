This piece about moving away from CDK is a bit overly dramatic and comes down to "CloudFormation sucks" which is something that anybody who's worked with it can testify to.

That said if you're committed to AWS as your cloud provider, CDK is an amazing piece of technology that bridges the worlds of infrastructure operations and programming.

If the concept of bridged terraform providers for pulumi is something that proves itself, that of course would be great, but I'd say it's still pretty uncertain.
