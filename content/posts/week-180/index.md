Last week was concerned with finalizing stuff for the first presentation of _guadalajara_. The current concept was more exploratory, we do not seem to have found the point of relevance yet to move forward.

A friendly neighborhood visit to the nice people at [Johnny Wonder](http://www.johnnywonder.nl/). And another chat about open data for the city of Amsterdam. Also continued writing a bunch more proposals.

Finally finished importing the videos and the race times for Wip ‘n’ Kip on [the PLAY Pilots website](http://playpilots.nl). [Glorious slow motion](http://playpilots.nl/games/wip-n-kip/#races) for you to behold.
