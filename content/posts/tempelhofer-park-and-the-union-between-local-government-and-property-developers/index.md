There is a shack on Tempelhofer Feld that explains the senate's plans with the park and the construction they plan to do there:

The people of [100% Tempelhofer Feld](https://www.facebook.com/thf100) with an alternate view are not allowed to express their view on the park itself. Reading through their facebook feed for the past weeks is a collection of absurdism that beggars belief. Truth is stranger than fiction.

And now the city has started a campaign where they found people willing to shill for construction on the field in videos such as these:

They don't mention how much these people have been paid for their participation. Maybe [a human flesh search](https://www.facebook.com/alper.cugun/posts/10151922583076503?stream_ref=1) for these people would be a good idea to track them down and ask them what they really think.

Anyway the entire thing is turning into a travesty where capitalism and the corrupt local government get what they want regardless. There is [a term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#Economy) for such an unholy alliance though it has fallen slightly out of use in Germany these past decades.
