So it turns out that 3G over Blau in Berlin is good enough to watch a Twitch stream of the DAC finals between Evil Geniuses and Vici Gaming and allowed me to watch the amazing Storm Spirit performance by SumaiL in the last match.

The finals started at around 8AM (China Standard Time) and unfortunately were [a clean sweep for EG](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/5555-dota-2-asia-championships/1461-main-event/5559-playoffs/matches/65858-vici-gaming-vs-evil-geniuses-dota2) so they were over pretty quickly. Most impressive was the fact that SumaiL, a fifteen year old kid from Pakistan, stole the show. Watch a summary below.
