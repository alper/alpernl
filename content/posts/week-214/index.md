A busy week, _maguro_ got completely finished and delivered to client. _Culiacan_ managed to overcome the horrible [Media Temple](http://mediatemple.net/) hurdle.

I spent a day working on _potosi_ on site at [de Groene Amsterdammer](http://www.groene.nl) at their swanky new pad on the Singel which [went live](http://www.groene.nl/2011/16/interactief-de-volledige-bijdragen-van-75-sociale-wetenschappers) that very same day.

Also posted my obligatory iPhone trail of the past half year:
