I got a mail this week that I had won a [FON](http://www.fon.com) router.

They had a contest some time ago that you could win a router if you sent in a picture of the view from your front window. I sent one in, and now they're going to send me a router.

So Oliver, you can have yours back (I had borrowed his to test some stuff). I think I'll be flashing it to Advanced immediately and spend some more time trying to configure it at home.
