Cities like Barcelona are starting to fight back against AirBnB and tourism.

I recently refused to help some local tourists to call the bike share hotline in German. We were legitimately in a hurry but my flat out refusal was not appreciated. Next time I'll tell them I won't be helping them because I do not support tourism.
