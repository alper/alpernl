Joel can be a bit obnoxious from time to time, but he is also right more often than not. The two tend to go hand in hand.

In his latest column —[“The Perils of JavaSchools”](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html)— he dismisses Java as a programming language and colleges where it is the only programming language that is taught. The wording may be a bit from the hip, but he is quite right.

Java is useless for most work, if you can just as easily use [Python](http://www.python.org).

And we do not call the schools that only teach Java universities in Holland, we call them HBO (vocational training school).

Now we like to gripe about [DUT](http://www.tudelft.nl) a lot but seeing what Joel thinks makes a good programmer, I think DUT is doing a pretty good job educating us:

- **C** Yes, we get a introductory course of C with pointer arithmetic and homegrown data structures.

- **Functional Programming** This has also always been included in the curriculum and thankfully they switched away from CaML to Haskell. Functional programming, if done in [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) is (difficult but) great.

Now, let's see what extra stuff we get to chew on:

- **Assembly** The first year practical in assembly is something most students look back upon with dread (at least I do), but it is a formative course for any computer science student.

- **Logic Programming** A practical in Prolog is part of the course in Logic. I liked it but most people think it is difficult.

And I also spent six years of my life learning **Latin** and I do agree that it trains your mind, your memory and your language skills.

So, Joel, am I overqualified or what?
