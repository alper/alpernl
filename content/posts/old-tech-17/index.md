After a long period of undemocratic manoeuvring in European policy making surrounding the Software Patentability Directive we finally get a chance to cast a vote and to be heard.

[Florian Mueller](http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/about/founder.html) respected anti-patent lobbbyist has been nominated for the position of European of the year. See the [article at NoSoftwarePatents.com](http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/ev50/index.html).

If he wins this election, this will be a very visible blow against software patents. Winning in the media and for the eye of the public is incredibly important step towards achieving a political victory.

So go to the [page with voting recommendations from NoSoftwarePatents.com](http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/ev50/vote.html) and take five minutes to help fight the fight.

This is the future of our innovation that is at stake.
