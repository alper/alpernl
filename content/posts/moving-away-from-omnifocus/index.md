I started a new job and thought I'd try out [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) for a change after using [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) very intensively at the last job. Things felt a bit constricting and I thought I'd try out the alternative app for a change.

Turns out this was a huge mistake.

1. Don't learn a new productivity application while starting a new job. This was a lot more annoying than I expected it to be. In part also because…
1. OmniFocus is extremely unpolished. I don't know what they are doing with the monthly subscription pricing that they cash but developing the applications is not it. The tool is extremely bare and missing huge swaths of basic functionality out of some kind of misguided principle. Their quick add window looks and works terribly and is a bad parody of the one that Things has. The interface design looks like something I could also have whipped up (and I consider myself largely design blind).
1. OmniFocus is also very old and has gone through a bunch of version updates which makes all of the user guides and documentation hard to sift through. I've more than once been reading about stuff that didn't exist anymore in the current app.

I will be switching back to Things as soon as I can find out how to purchase it in the correct way. And because both of these tools are fairly popular there's an exporter/importer so I don't have to type everything over manually.
