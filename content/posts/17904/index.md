In Germany for many transactions you need a proof of address which a _Personalausweis_ provides for German citizens. Us foreigners don't get one however often we ask for it. In the Netherlands moving through the country without a battery of chip cards (OV chipkaart, Bonuskaart, OV-fiets etc.), apps and associated services is costly and annoying.

The signs have been there for a while but China seems to be pushing this much further along. The question is whether it's a deliberate move or that the number of people affected is so small that they're a negligible edge case for the policy makers over there.
