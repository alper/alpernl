I didn't make it out to [dConstruct](http://2012.dconstruct.org/) which I'm a bit torn about. I've been to the conference some three times and htis year other priorities trumped it and going to conferences in general. But the program this year was even more stellar than regular years. Seeing either [Ben Hammersley](https://www.benhammersley.com/), [Tom Armitage](http://infovore.org/) or [James Burke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_(science_historian)) (!) present would be worth the ticket price alone without exaggerating a lot.

When the theme ‘Playing with the Future’ was announced I was already thinking that [Paul Virilio](http://www.vice.com/read/paul-virilio-506-v17n9) should feature in it. Can somebody confirm to me whether he has been referenced at all? Too often designers put their belief wholesale into the notion of progress and a heavy-weight counterpoint to that thinking would be more or less essential.

And best of all was hearing from a distance about [Tom Armitage's presentation](http://2012.dconstruct.org/conference/armitage/) which seemed to be really good and focuses on the same things we do in our practice: play and making.

As fellow game makers that very notion is at the heart of many of the things we do and it is a talk I will definitely be [catching on the conference recordings](http://archive.dconstruct.org/2012/makingfriends) which are already online.
