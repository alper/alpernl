Listened to the latest episode of the German eGovernment podcast with the Minister for Digital for Bavaria. That is the state here that's seemingly the farthest along when it comes to digitalisation and it now has the following ambitious plans:

- to have internet reception everywhere
- to remove fax traffic inside the state government by 2026

And then I switched it off because I don't think anything good could come after that.
