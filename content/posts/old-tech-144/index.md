Adam Arvidsson - Sociology ABC

Reboot8

Unstable bond of sociology

Language

Simian vs. Human sociality

Simian sociality is unsntable, monkeys have to continuously reaffirm relations

Humans have more stability inherent because of technology eg. language

Religion is also an important technology

Early religions:

-totems, identity, who you are

-myths, explains how the world works, purpose, why, how

-rituals

Make society possible, enduring set of social relations specific to human beings

Technology: state, print, government etc.

New set of technologies, industrial production, mass consumption, mass literacy, state, bureaucracies, rational organizations

Il Principe as the first sociological tract?

Sociology as a academic scientific discipline develops in the 1850s

Community, permanent enduring in time, linked to the land

vs.

Society, money, state etc.

Society: Social facts, regularities within the mobile mass

Statistics, application of arithmetic ot the administration of population and territory

Modern society consists of a network of social facts which is called social structure

Parsons: we have values that influence culture (norms, principles, tangible forms of behaviour) which influences personality (internalized version of social structure) which influences the biological structure of action

Agency

Parsons: people act according to the implementation of the structure

social structures construct actors, can be different social structures

when two actors interact, the outcome is uncertain, the relation is still undetermined

Where does social structure end and where does agency start?

Symbolic interactionism, how people construct social relations in the freedom they have

how do people use items from social structure to construct relations

Experiment: told students to take other people literally

Disembedding

Remediation

Uprooting

Taking apart the natural bonds of community

Society marked by social structure, large scale regularities in behaviour maybe institutionalized maybe immaterial

Critical Theory: continuation of German romantic philosophy...

21st century sociology

Structure is gone, dissolved into flows of money, people, information

Agency dissolves into intensities

20th century agent had a coherent personality re: Freud

different contexts situation yield different personalities

home vs. work

net vs. real life

Different intensities

Return of the social object

Conclusion:

21st century society begins to look like simian society

Much less stable social bonds

Type of sociality now continuously activates us as productive agency, have to keep reproducing the social bond
