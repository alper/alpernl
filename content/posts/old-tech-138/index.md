Ok, after three days of session after session, bad WiFi following bad WiFi, [XTECH](http://www.xtech.org) has finally come to an end. My general thoughts are positive but with some reservations.

I enjoyed some of the presentations' topics but mostly I was interested enough in those topics that the presentation did not have much added value anymore. Most of the presentations were bird's eye views of the topic.

I also saw a couple of presentations that were really too boring to sit through. The presentation quality in this field seems to be quite widely distributed.

One thing I couldn't help noticing was that any time a presentation would be about the semantic web[^1], the average age in the room would rise with at least 10 years. I don't know if these people haven't figured out that if nobody is using their technology after a couple of decades, than maybe it might not be that big an hit.

Let's get out of the semantic web and into quick and [dirty semantics](http://www.plasticbag.org/).

It was very interesting and cool to see and talk to people whose writings I am already very familiar with. Seeing the real faces behind the blogs and the passion for the topics is inspiring.

[^1]: Presentations concerning the semantic web can be easily recognized because they have the acronym RDF somewhere in the description.
