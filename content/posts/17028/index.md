My functional journey went a bit like this:

"Oh wouldn't it be nice if I could do FP with javascript because I already know that!"

"Argh, javascript libraries are terrible."

"Oh no every sublanguage has its own broken transpiler (or whatever you call this)."

"And the documentation is all over the place and often half finished."

"So the only serious options for hardcore functional programming are Haskell and Scala."

"Scala, just no. Bah."

"Haskell is nice but you can't do anything serious with it."

"Extensions? Why are these not documented?"

"Running Haskell? Start doing a PhD on Nix and then we'll talk."

"OK. I guess I'll write Clojure which has a nice syntax and takes advantage of the maturity of the JVM."

"Ah, another small language with a fragmented and stagnant ecosystem."

"I give up. Whatever functional features Rust has will have to be good enough."

"Let me learn some category theory for fun."

"So category theory has almost no relationship to real functional programming and all that endofunctor stuff is just a fancy way of saying 'Fuck you!'??"

"No desire to ever touch this stuff again. Maybe I'll try logic programming instead."
