Recovering from flu meant a week of mostly broken days, but still got a lot done and more importantly: got better.

TORREON is more or less finished with the client accepting the work into their own repository now.

Tuesday we had an board meeting with Open State. I added [my thoughts](https://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/no-exit-strategy-intended-anyone-else-here-for-the-long-game/#comment-4424) to Emma Mulqueeny's post about social entrepreneurship and the long game. We are struggling with the same issues but optimistic.

I had a meeting over at [Netzpolitik](https://netzpolitik.org/) for our upcoming joint venture with Open State as well.

I wrote this blog post about real thinkers anywhere on the continent [^1]: [“Who still thinks in Germany?”](/dingen/2013/01/who-still-thinks-in-germany/)

Finally I had a nice coffee with recent Berlin arrival [Jurriaan](http://iksi.tv/) who I think is a great addition to the local tech scene.

On Saturday I dropped by the extra [Apps and the City hackday](http://appsandthecity.net/apps/) and turned [my python hack](http://appsandthecity.net/apps/app/stationsrouter.html) into a javascript version for better distribution and graphical presentation. The javascript community disappointed me because there wasn't a graph based A\* solver available anywhere, so I was forced to write my own version using [the Wikipedia pseudocode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Pseudocode) and [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/). That now [lives on Github](https://github.com/MonsterSwell/stationrouter). It still needs a bunch of work.

Further I also updated my Thinkup installation to [the most recent beta](http://blog.thinkup.com/post/41482415653/thinkup-2-0s-second-beta-now-available) and my Dreamhost account to a VPS but still haven't gotten it to work properly. I'm hoping that outage does not take too long.

[^1]: Which may have been slightly more inflammatory than necessary, but then again, who hates a nice controversy.
