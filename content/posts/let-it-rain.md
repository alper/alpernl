A long held dream came true for me with the delivery this week of my first light stand and umbrella combination. I wanted to play with studio photography longer already, but what really brought it home was following [Dustin Diaz's](http://twitter.com/ded) [Project 365](http://www.flickr.com/photos/polvero/sets/72157611811908959/) where he did an interesting strobist setup for every day of 2009. I learned so much from that.

So now I can shoot portraits with off camera soft directed light. This is just the beginning:
