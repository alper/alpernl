Here's Simon Willison [writing about how he approaches his link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/#atom-everything).

I do something along similar lines here. I share links to various things that I find interesting and try to add what I think is interesting about them. From here I then schedule posts to Bluesky, Mastodon and LinkedIn using [Buffer](https://www.buffer.com).

I'm not sure who reads my stuff here but I know for sure that people see the exhaust on those platforms. The main reason why I blog them here is to have my own repository of knowledge and links for if I ever have to refer back to it. For that I annotate things in a way where I hopefully can find it again and use site search to find ‘that one link about X I shared a while back’.

So yes, Wordpress works just fine as a personal knowledge management system.
