I [had briefly tested](http://alper.nl/blog/tech/188) Windows Vista a couple of weeks ago and I came to pretty much the same conclusions as Ken Mingis from [the Computerworld piece “Hands on: A Mac fan takes on Vista”](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9003672).

I did not write them out because I thought they were overly judgmental, unnuanced and very much subjective. It seems if you *do* write them out you can cause quite a ripple in the blogosphere.
