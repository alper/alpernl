This week returning from my [new haunt in Amsterdam](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/sets/72157621106745398/) back to Delft, walking the streets with an appetite for beer I felt strangely disconnected.

Together with [Robert](http://twitter.com/robertgaal) we persuaded the kind people of [Four Square](http://playfoursquare.com/) to open up a branch in Amsterdam. Being one of the starters of the service here means I'm friends with tons of people. Knowing what is happening in the city, where the cool bars and restaurants are and immediately knowing who's having a beer right now and where, is fantastic.

S&W say that being able [to see through a city](http://schulzeandwebb.com/hat/) is a superpower. If so, Four Square is the superpower of being able to smell beer miles away.

Once you're used to a service such as this and the peripheral vision it provides —and does ever so unintrusively ((I have my pings set to off for now.))— walking around a city which doesn't have it feels like having blinders on.
