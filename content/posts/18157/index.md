I think this critique of Flamework is a bit rich coming from the author of Flask with its global request object. But there is a point in being able to iterate really quickly, it's even better to be able to work crudely without creating a disastrous unmaintainable mess.

There is a difference between writing terrible code well or writing beautiful code poorly.
