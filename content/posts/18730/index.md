And with that we are over to a new blogging system. It's not exactly because blogging is still a thing, but I use this as a personal content repository for the things that I share out so having it under control is useful.

Reading back all those old posts and weeknotes I have here is super nice and reminds me:

1. Keeping a record of things is really valuable. Just write and trust that it will come in handy at some point.
2. I used to do so many things in a given week. Compared to what I'm doing now, my life was insanely eventful.
3. I was consistently (too) early on a lot of things. For instance: I read myself complaining about restaurants and food in Amsterdam, something which is mostly solved now.

The main reasons why I'm moving away from Wordpress:

Poorly configured hosts have botched UTF-8 on MySQL for so many times now that the entire blog was riddled with weird encoding errors. I [tried a while back](/posts/17649) to get them out with custom SQL statements, but it turns out I wasn't successful. PHP/MySQL is losing adoption and the more people refuse to use it, the sooner it'll die.

Even the cheapest hosting is not that cheap anymore. I'm at [Vimexx](https://www.vimexx.nl/) and, because I didn't have an exit, in September I was forced to pay €102.44 for a year of hosting. That money does not buy me anything other than poorly usable, super outdated admins and a base that won't run anything other than PHP shit apps. I'm keeping my stuff on there, since I already paid, but this time I won't be forced to renew.

Matt Mullenweg [has gone off the deep end](https://ma.tt/2024/12/inc-hit-piece/) as have many tech leaders during the Trump administration. I'll admit that this is minor but still worth mentioning.
