Running behind two weeks and off to the Netherlands tomorrow (for a talk at [a Crosslab event](http://extra.wdka.nl/crosslab/2012/03/14/crosslab-event-dynamic-design/) in the Unie). Oh how time flies! This was a fun week.

On Monday development for saba started in earnest and there was much hacking in Phonegap. Or Cordova, or whatever the project is called these days. By now we have abandoned that approach for reasons that are forthcoming but it was fun while it lasted.

On Tuesday I went to Gobsquad's Kitchen mostly on [a recommendation from Kevin Slavin](http://slavin.tumblr.com/post/16743630426/if-youre-in-nyc-go-see-gob-squads). That was a very entertaining show.

I finally found a Steuerberater here who seem to be good at what they are doing and friendly.

On Friday I accompanied Alexander and Ernst-Jan who were visiting Berlin on a tour of the former Stasi remand prison in Hohenschönhausen.

Hack de Overheid now has [a Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/hack-de-overheid) where everybody can have their say. It still needs a bit of a startup, but these things always do.
