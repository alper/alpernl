The week before this is getting a bit boring, but as soon as the current project is over I promise that adventures will resume again.

German lessons continued even with one of our participants being back in the Netherlands:

Sun was enjoyed at last after the gruelling Berlin winter we had to endure:

And my laptop crashed again during the week and this time because I had already performed all backups and come to terms with the mortality of the device, this time the decision was quickly made to buy a new laptop. This is something I should have done a year ago.

And I'm noticing that Berlin police are very helpful if you're cyclist. One example:

Also I don't understand why it takes 9 people to detain one black guy.](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8546/8628114790_2b7faa923f_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8628114790/ "Berlin police being fucking helpful and blocking the bike path.
