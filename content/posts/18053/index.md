This was exactly a discussion I had yesterday where when teams reach higher levels of maturity, they may catch and fix issues internally before they become full blown incidents.

So how do we than make sure we are not over-indexing on purely the operational surprises where we ran the heavy incident machinery and how do we get the right learnings and improvements disseminated throughout the organisation?

(I know how. The "how" here is how to get there.)
