Tooling has become so good and so empowering that like in this tweet, many commerce ‘startups’ that are really struggling to hire and retain dev teams (and then utilize them to their potential) would be much better served using Airtable, Zapier and Pipedrive until they break.

More likely in any case that the startup will go out of business or be acquired than it hitting the limits of those kinds of tools.
