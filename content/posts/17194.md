A large part of the movement back to the office is because a lot of commercial real estate is under water. That's where all the opinion pieces in the FT are coming from.

Also the LPs—who probably have way more exposure to real estate than they do to venture—definitely talk to the GPs who then lean on their founders.

(I say this as somebody who has a lot of experience with remote work but who also likes being in a nice office.)
