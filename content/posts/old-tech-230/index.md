Just was at the Studio Statensingel attending the One More Thing Macworld Keynote Party. Pictures up in a bit.

Everybody's eagerly anticipated iPhone fortunately saw the light of day and it was everything everybody could have wished for. For instance the silde to unlock button has the tactile oomph that is just great.

I haven't seen any multi-touch features demoed yet, most of it was either single-tap or dragging which are already quite impressive. Also missing are displays of the backside of the thing. What does the camera look like and what kind of lens is it?

For us in the Netherlands it's going to be **a long walk to the iPhone**. It's due to be released somewhere halfway this year but there's no telling yet when it'll debut in the Netherlands.

Also the prices listed were including two-year Cingular deals. That leaves the question open how much they are without a two year operator shackle so you can import them and run them with your Dutch SIM.

Anyway [my cellphone](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/196051154/) has been due for replacement a while now and my contract with T-mobile is also just finished and I happen to have some [extra money](http://www.nu.nl/news.jsp?n=921730&c=50) lying around. What *shall* I do?
