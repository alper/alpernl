The Flash based online presentation creator [Empressr](http://www.empressr.com/) looks nice and interesting. Upon first use this feeling is replaced with sheer frustration.

Flash GUIs' lack of anything resembling a HIG, a uniform widget look and feel or any set of consistent affordances makes me despair at every control. I have no clue if something is a button, or a list, needs to be double clicked or dragged or can be acted upon at all.

Flash should get over itself and use the available system standard widgets.
