The amount of new features in C# 3.0 is vast. This [score card](http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000333.html) is not completely positive about all of them. Additions to a programming language should be extremely well thought out and absolutely necessary.

Though I like C# and I think some of the new features are dead sexy, I am seeing that they expand the language surface a great deal.

It just is more to learn. That and recent news that there is a shortage in C# programmers will probably combine to drive up the price of C# sharp programmers and to slow adoption.
