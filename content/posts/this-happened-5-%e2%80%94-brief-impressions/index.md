Yesterday I attended the fifth edition of [This Happened](http://thishappened.nl/) in Utrecht city. It was a great new iteration with more polish even though it was also a big step up moving the entire event to [a new venue](http://www.hku.nl/web/Faculteiten/Akademietheater.htm).

[![Paper Cakes](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4001/4379996650_cc506d8530.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/4379996650/ "Paper Cakes by illustir, on Flickr")

See [the This Happened site](http://thishappened.nl/) for the presentations of this session.

The [Papercakes](http://bamboo.wacom.eu/minis/en/#/mini/PaperCakes) presentation was interesting, though I would have wished that they'd focused more on the creative process and not so much on the implementation and user testing. It is a very compelling game and I'm now even more seriously considering buying a [Bamboo](http://bamboo.wacom.eu/) for my desk.

The [Love Hate Punch](http://www.stefangross.nl/love_hate_punch.html) punching bag hit close to home for me as I used to have a bag like that at home and I definitely can relate to the aggression remediating effects of such a bag. It was an epic story of how to create something interesting using mostly home brew and tenacity.

The [Swinxs](http://www.swinxs.com/) is impossible not to like. The presentation was oddly paced, but still everybody thought it was great and got a great look behind the process of putting a digital toy on the store shelves (quite a feat!).

[Daan Roosegaarde](http://www.studioroosegaarde.nl/index.php?project_name=LiquidSpace6.0) went off in all kinds of tangents talking about creating poetic interactions for public space. His installations are in a league of their own and are a custom designed experience for a certain area. I have experienced LiquidSpace but I had a hard time getting much more out of it than its novelty.

This Happens seems to have arrived at a next level with a space that is comfortable and organizers that are comfortable within that space. Let's see what's next.
