Yesterday after work on a very sunny flip-floppy afternoon caught the train to Amsterdam with [Yun](http://www.savvy.nl/blog/) and [Redmar](http://www.redmar.net/).

I met the guys [Mek & Tosj](http://www.mekentosj.com/) who have a site with a lot of OS X software and who know a lot about OS X development showed me their site and their widgets (on of which: the [Tigergotchi](http://www.mekentosj.com/widgets/tigergotchi/index.html) widget). I hadn't really looked into widget development really but after a brief run through of their widget bundle I could see that there really is nothing to it (more on that later).

The guys from [Fleck](http://www.fleck.com/) were very evasive about their startup not saying much about it but saying a lot more about other things. Their new site [betafy](http://www.betafy.com/) is funny enough and taps into the hype that is [the Next Web](http://upcoming.org/event/72734/).

After a night of chaos, socializing and demonstrations, I decided to take the last train home with Redmar and Yun. This train due to some freakish chance of the schedule took us one and a half hour to get back to Delft.

I was planning on coming back today but the reality of my schedule hit and I couldn't. [Reinier](http://www.zwitserloot.com/) went today to the hackathon part and I have kept track of it partly through the video stream.

I'll be back for [BarCamp II](http://upcoming.org/event/67999/).
