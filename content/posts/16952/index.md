There is a belief in software that making something work is such deep magic or so complicated, that you should be happy with anything.

It's not true. It has been possible for a while now to develop (any) software linearly, rationally, predictably.

The reason it persists is because it covers for a lack of competence and helps to abdicate responsibility.
