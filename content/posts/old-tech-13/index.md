My first step on joining the [microformat](http://www.microformats.org/) frenzy is by converting [my contact details](http://www.alper.nl/contact.html) to a hCard format.

Both the [hCard](http://www.microformats.org/wiki/hcard) and the [hCalendar](http://www.microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar) microformats are derivatives of the vCard and iCalendar standards transformed into XHTML.

The specifications are probably complete enough, but not really exhaustive. Both of them point back to the RFCs of the original formats.

Since I have neither the time (or the inclination) to read two huge RFCs, I went looking for clear examples. For the hCard these are easily found [on the wiki](http://www.microformats.org/wiki/hcard-examples) but not so for the hCalendar.

There are enough resources (eg. simple generators), but nothing beats a comprehensive set of examples.
