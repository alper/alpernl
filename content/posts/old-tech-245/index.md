I went to the Web 2.0 drink hosted by Tijs and [René](http://winkwaves.com/) in the Hague tonight and I talked a bit to various internet sorts and got exposed to a whole lot of [Jaiku](http://jaiku.com).

I had already claimed [my online presence](http://alper.jaiku.com) at Jaiku, but hadn't given it much thought since. [Mark](http://novemberborn.net) said that their recently released version was cool and Tijs briefly showed me the Jaiku mobile client on his Nokia.

The site is really usable and pretty social right now and the mobile app is nothing short of impressive. This really is a solid implementation of the vision Jyri Engeström laid out during his talk at Reboot called [“Blind Men's Baseball”](http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2006/07/blind_mens_base.html) (great presentation).

The timing of this is pretty opportune since I was annoyed silly by a barrage of semi-nonsensical SMSes from [Twitter](http://twitter.com) lately. It seems like Twitter implements just one dimension in this space and not too well.

I turned off the SMS notification (end the pain, please!) and left [a goodbye message](http://twitter.com/alper/statuses/5805571) for the Twitter folk.

Now just to get my hands on a somewhat more recent phone and a decent plan so I can play with the mobile presence part.
