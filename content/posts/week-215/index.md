Blogged about project _potosi_: [Interactive Infographic for de Groene Amsterdammer](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2011/04/interactive-infographic-for-de-groene-amsterdammer/) also blogged about _hermosillo_: [Mapping voter sentiment in the Netherlands](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2011/04/mapping-voter-sentiment-in-the-netherlands/)

We did a bunch of writing among which some proposals for academic conferences where we are going to drop some knowledge & praxis.

_Culiacan_ and Statlas are moving forward at a steady pace.
