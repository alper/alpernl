Tonight I saw the magical [Symphonie Cinétique works at MADE in Berlin](http://made-blog.com/2013/09/symphonie-cinetique-the-pieces/).

[Iepe Rubingh](http://www.iepe.net/) who I to my shame only met last night told me about these beautiful works of art by Joachim Sauter (and music by Ólafur Arnalds) and this being the last chance to see them. I don't think I have really seen a music and installation piece before where both parts combine this well. [Julio Le Parc's](http://www.julioleparc.org/) kinetic [work in the Palais de Tokyo](http://www.palaisdetokyo.com/fr/expositions/archives-expositions) is comparable, but this is better.

This is Berlin at its finest.
