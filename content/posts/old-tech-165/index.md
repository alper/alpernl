I have finally buckled under the pressure and I am doing an attempt at learning PHP. I'm perusing [the manual](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php) at PHP.net and what I am reading is highly appalling.

When I see the crap that is the PHP language I only can think: ‘What were they thinking?’
