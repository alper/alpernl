More people have mentioned it and I think it should be part of every Rust tutorial to encourage people to just `clone()` whenever they get in a jam and get their stuff done: “keep calm, clone and move on”. I think that one thing will make it possible to onboard any team onto Rust quickly and get them shipping.

Performance will still be better than in most other languages and you can optimize this stuff out after you've got things to work.
