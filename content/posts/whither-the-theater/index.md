Talking to two young theater makers yesterday, I remarked that the majority of the Dutch plays I see don't deliver the relevant and socially engaged experiences I would want them to. To which they asked why I still bothered going to the theater, a question I hear regularly from those in the more modern performing arts. They themselves hardly ever go and they make participatory theater, not the stage dramas that first come to mind. That is a response I get more often: that theater is boring, irrelevant and really **‘Why would anybody want to go?’**

I often think the same on my obligatory trips to the [Stadsschouwburg Amsterdam](http://www.ssba.nl/) and other venues. What I need in theater is a visceral quality, acute social relevance and deep street savvy. One of those is hard enough to find most of the time, let alone all three. I went to 33 plays last year and only a handful of them delivered. The few that did, redeemed the boring, too long, too simple plays I've been to, but I think that there are irresolvable obstacles preventing the quality of theater from increasing.

On most of my visits I'm struck by how narrow a demographic (by age and social-economic status) frequents most theaters. This cannot but influence the performances to cater to the audience. The audience's wishes notwithstanding, artistic autonomy would require boundaries to be pushed, but that too doesn't happen all too often (see also [‘De studio uit, de wereld in’](/dingen/2011/10/de-studio-uit-de-wereld-in/)).

Having said that, the theater makers I would go to blindly in the Netherlands are:

- Theu Boermans ((Of epic Theatercompagnie fame, now making a glorious return as head of het Nationaal Toneel.))
- Thibaud Delpeut
- Eric de Vroedt
- Ivo van Hove

Now having just moved to Berlin, I've seen a bunch of plays at [die Schaubühne](http://www.schaubuehne.de/) ((Visits to HAU, Ballhaus Naunynstraße and die Volksbühne are planned.)) but nothing very titillating yet. That may be in part because I am yet to see something by Thomas Ostermeier, but it does beg the question why a theater would stage such wildly varying material and why the room still is full most of the nights. Answers to those questions are forthcoming after a more thorough sampling.
