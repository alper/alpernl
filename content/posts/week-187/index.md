A short remaindered weeknote (a rather awesome event and dinner packed week indeed):

Monday had dinner with our informal hedge fund association whose members shall stay anonymous. Suffice it to say: they're a swell sort.

Finishing up my end of the Urbanode, the local systems integration and being the programmer on the ground. Handed that over to [Peter Robinett](http://www.bubblefoundry.com/) on Friday.

Most of the rest of the week was concerned with preparing my [presentation for the Club of Amsterdam](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2010/09/speaking-at-the-club-of-amsterdam/) on Thursday and then putting [the slides with notes and references for that](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2010/10/slides-for-civic-duty-in-a-hyper-connected-world/) online.

Had a talk with [D66](http://d66.nl) council member [Sebastiaan Capel](http://twitter.com/sebastiaancapel) with ideas from my own practice and of the wider tech community on how to improve the state of the city of Amsterdam. I eagerly await his transcript of that talk.

Wednesday I was invited to the Microsoft Design Mind Salon with [Bill Buxton](http://www.billbuxton.com/), an awe inspiring design mind if ever there was one. After that I went to the drinks of the Design by Fire Event (a great event by all accounts) and caught up with friends old and [new](http://twitter.com/trenti) for dinner.

Thursday was the presentation day with speakers' dinner. Had an interesting talk with [Arjen Kamphuis](http://twitter.com/arjenkamphuis) of [Gendo](http://www.gendo.nl/).

Friday I rounded up my administration before my [trip to the Levant](/dingen/2010/10/gone-fishing/).
