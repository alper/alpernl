You probably would not have noticed, but I installed [Explorer Destroyer](http://www.explorerdestroyer.com) on the [front page](http://www.alper.nl). Most regular visitors of these pages do not use IE, most people stumbling by via Google or another search do use it.

And playing further with [AdSense](http://adsense.google.com) I thought I would see what an ad bar to the left here would do. It's pretty unobtrusive and I would be surprised if it would have any noticeable effect.

Comments, objections?
