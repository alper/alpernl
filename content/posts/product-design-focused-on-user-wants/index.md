This post was previously [published on Medium](https://medium.com/@alper/product-design-focused-on-user-wants-484d04cfa572) and is now archived here.

There’s some recent writing about the decomposition of apps into either thin slivers of [single purpose functionality](http://hunterwalk.com/2014/06/23/random-yo-slingshot-product-hunt-yelp-competition-taptalk/) per app or even [breaking out of the traditional app domain](https://medium.com/five-hundred-words/there-is-no-app-694813fa2167) entirely and delivering their functionality through for instance [the notifications screen](http://www.wired.com/2014/06/smartphone-notifications/).

I think both of these are onto something but that the trend itself is more fundamental. I think there are three things happening.

### 1\. Apps can be decomposed into high-level user wants.

A want starts with “I want”and is followed by getting or creating something often accompanied by some social intermediation. Such a want could be “I want to send a message”or it could be “I want to read (and reply to) my messages”or it could be “I want to find a place to eat.”

These are not utilities. Most interesting apps these days are lifestyle apps. Focusing on a single want does not mean the app becomes easier to make. Implementing a want with its very specific functionality, appropriate context, user interface and communication may be even more difficult. A want is a summary of what used to be called ‘user stories’ but focused on what people want to do not on what people are supposed to do. At the risk of sounding obvious: people don’t want to do things they don’t want to do. The exception to this is work where people do things they don’t want to do. People want apps that bring them entertainment, social connections or self-actualisation.

### 2\. Apps cannot support more than a couple of wants well.

Any app that tries to cram in more than a couple of wants from different domains starts to creak and feel cluttered. This looks like the main reason why Foursquare unbundled the totally disparate wants of local discovery “I want to find a good restaurant now”and that of social broadcasting “I want to tell my friends where I am.”

Such unbundling is becoming the norm because an app cannot do everything well without containing multiple apps. Just think back of Facebook’s everything-and-the-kitchen-sink app with its own homescreen. The Facebook app itself is becoming more and more bare while wants are increasingly delivered by apps that don’t show they belong to Facebook.

This is a good indicator of what the future holds for these apps. I would for instance be surprised if complicated list management features would be a significant part of the future Foursquare mobile app. Lists do support local discovery but they will never have the mass appeal the app is focusing on.

### 3\. Wants can be fulfilled anywhere you want.

This ties into [Naveen’s piece about the notifications](http://x.naveen.com/post/88694239280/notifications-as-the-app-itself) becoming the app. I would take this further and say that the app will be wherever people interact with a connected device. Building an app becomes a matter of translating a user want into the interaction affordances of a medium.

You could indeed read and reply to messages in a notification screen if that is where you spend your time. But soon you might do the same thing using the same app but on your connected watch. In a somewhat more distant future you might send a Yo! by slamming two IoT enabled rocks together.

The medium through which a want is fulfilled has become flexible. What matters is the want itself and appropriateness. A talented designer will figure out whether a translation makes sense and how to best implement it.

All in all this is a great development. Digital design is breaking out of screens enabling it to find us where we are and offer us the things we really want.
