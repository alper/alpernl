Lifting choice quotes from the proceedings of the Berkman [Hyperpublic](http://www.hyperpublic.org/) event graciously compiled by [Ethan Zuckerman](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/?page_id=15).

Here about privacy and how it should be a forward thinking discipline instead of a reactionary one:

> “I don’t like privacy. It tends to be too closely associated with fear, and it always seems like a rear-guard action against technology.”Instead, we should work on the architecture of the public space and ensuring we architect for private space. — [Charlie Nesson and a new vision of the public domain](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2011/06/10/charlie-nesson-and-a-new-vision-of-the-public-domain/)
