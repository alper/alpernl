For another maddening detail in the horrid world of PHP.

I restored a Drupal backup to a webserver and didn't bother to check if the PHP versions matched. Then I struggled for some time with pages coming up without errors but also without any content.

It seems that a backed up Drupal from PHP 4 does not work on a PHP 5 server. Very nice compatibility, guys.
