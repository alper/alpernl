I got nerd sniped pretty hard by somebody sharing a Django code challenge: "only touch views.py and optimize a page load to a time and memory budget in 60 minutes".

Started it before going to bed just to see if I still had it and 0.3s and 38MB say that I do still have it. Django is also a king among frameworks.
