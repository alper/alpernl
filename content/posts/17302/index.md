As much as it pains me, I'm teaching myself Helix and trying out the Jetbrains IDEs. Code has been the first editor that really clicked for me but as with all free things, there's a hidden price to pay for it.

(Also the quality of VS Code seems to be going downhill. At some point if they keep developing software past completion, the software becomes crap.)
