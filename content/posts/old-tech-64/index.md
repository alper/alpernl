[Meetro](http://meetro.com/) looks rather nifty (watch the movie). Shame they don't have a Mac version available.

I see more and more corporate sites that slam a movie on the front page with actual people talking about their software experience. I like this a lot. I like it even more when the movie has a pause button.
