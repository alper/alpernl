I remember when I got banned from the forum of one of Germany's larger liberal podcasts for saying that Bitcoin is mostly something by and for criminals. I think that statement was pretty much entirely correct.

The story of the Texas Bitcoin mine is sad but we're living through something similar now where the construction site has installed yet another permanent noise device (a pump) next to our home. The noise level is not too high, but even if it were, it's not like anything would be done in Berlin about it.
