Two weeks ago I headed towards Amsterdam where I'll be the week after next again. I did a massive sprint on Cuppings and prepared my presentation for [Sign of Times](http://www.dezwijger.nl/page/72146/nl) in Pakhuis de Zwijger.

I worked on a bunch of projects over at Hubbub on Tuesday and on Wednesday I was there again but then to prepare my presentation. That talk went really well despite the torrential rains of the day and I had a great time catching up with the people who had showed up.

I caught up with [Daphne](https://www.facebook.com/daphnevanderkroft/posts/10151467695668543) on Thursday and wandered around the city a bit looking for good coffe which I found at the newly opened [Head First](http://www.headfirstcoffeeroasters.com/).

I finally ended up at the presentations of the Liquid Journalism masterclass and got to talk with [Alexander](http://www.alexanderzeh.me/) and [Laura](http://capitalonstage.com/author/laura-van-der-vlies/).

On Friday [Kars](http://leapfrog.nl/) got married which was the other main reason I was in the Netherlands for.
