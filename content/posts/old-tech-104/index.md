A [gem of a presentation](http://www.st.cs.uni-sb.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/sweeny.pdf) by Tim Sweeney from [Epic](http://www.epicgames.com/) about the next generation of programming languages [[via](http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000375.html)].

Sweeney posts an excellent take on the current state of programming languages and what is necessary to push stuff further on future platforms. Game developers being on the forefront of consumer high performance computing, he has some interesting insights.

Most of his comment relate to the compile time fetishism school of programming and static analysis. His main conclusion is that currently used programming languages (C++, C#, Java) can learn a whole lot from [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell).

The problems that he mentions: high demand for productivity and performance, necessary use of frameworks and third party libraries and troubles with concurrency are inherent in most software development and the solutions he gives should be interesting for most.
