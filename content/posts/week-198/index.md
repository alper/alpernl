The ephemeral week between Christmas and New Year's.

Wrote a bunch of stuff that was due among which a report on the demise of [TipiT](http://tipit.to).

Was busy doing planning for Dutchstats with [a week0 briefing](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2010/12/dutchstats2-week-0/).

Also did some stuff for [Hack de Overheid](http://hackdeoverheid.nl) a new website for which should be ready soonish.
