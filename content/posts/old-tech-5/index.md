Attending conferences is very cool but it is disproportionally difficult for those people on the wrong side of the pond with limited financial resources (i.e. me).

So every time one of these conferences drops by in our lovely city of Amsterdam, I should pay notice. The [EurOSCon](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/) conference is due in October but early bird registration for that has passed and even then it would have been too expensive for me.

What seems to be an alternative (or complementary) conference for that is the [Bar Camp Amsterdam](http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?BarCampAmsterdam) which is planned to run simultaneously. Looking at the [people](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2005/09/22/bar-camp-amsterdam/) [involved](http://michahernandez.blogspot.com/2005/09/bar-camp-amsterdam.html) and the [photographs](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/barcamp/) of the previous event this looks pretty cool.
