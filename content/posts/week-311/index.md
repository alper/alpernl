Last week we were on something of a tear continuously shipping things (it beats continuous integration). As Kars mentioned in [the Hubbub weeknotes](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/blog/2013/03/week-184/) I was featured in the rather shiny [TNW magazine](http://thenextweb.com/magazine/) about the subject of gamification. Much to my surprise this issue was filled with blabbering by Gabe Zichermann. It's not only that we take issue with the way he approaches games, it looks like everything about the man is shameful. You can [read unparalleled levels of douchebaggery over at Kevin Slavin](http://slavin.tumblr.com/post/43893717103/futuristgerd-to-meet-these-needs-we-believe) and to my dismay even [GigaOM](http://gigaom.com/) ((I thought GigaOM was a spark of light in the cesspool of tech journalism but it turns out I was wrong.)) is complicit.

To my shame it took me until Friday night to write [my second installment of Recess!](/dingen/2013/03/recess-4-glass/)

I also got in touch with the government of Tempelhof-Schöneberg to procure all building permits for the area which had some disappointing results. More on that later.
