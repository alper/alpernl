Browsing with Safari is pretty snappy, but that is probably the tradeoff for a further quite unstable browser.

My typical browser usage consists of opening lots and lots of tabs and then also closing lots and lots of tabs but never all of them. I always have 5-10 tabs open which I need to pay attention to at a certain point in time (but not now). My brower ToDo-list.

Every once in a while Safari will crash completely and take my entire todo-list with it. This combined with no feature to restore crashed sessions makes it unusable for serious browsing.

So from now on, for fast browsing Safari, for anything serious Firefox with the SessionSaver extension.
