[Lang maar boeiend artikel](http://newyorkmetro.com/news/features/16529/index.html) over de generatie volwassenen van nu die nooit de moeite hebben genomen om echt volwassen (en saai) te worden. Grups (zo worden ze genoemd) luisteren nog steeds nieuwe muziek, dragen gympen, spelen games, skateboarden en gaan uit.

Het interessantste deel van het artikel graaft in op de vraag waarom ze niet hetzelfde doen als hun ouders en het antwoord is: *“Passie”*.

> There’s that tricky word again: passion. What’s with the Grups and passion? It’s all anyone wants to talk about. Passionate parents, passionate workers, passionate listeners to the new album by Wolf Parade. Even Rogan lights up when he talks about touring Japanese textile factories to find the perfect denim for his jeans. And I start to realize: Under the skin of the iPods and the $400 ripped jeans, this is the spine of the Grup ethos: passion, and the fear of losing it.

> Which brings me back to my father: the one who wore suits, not jeans; the one who, when he was my age, already had four kids; the one who logged a lifetime at exactly the kind of middle-management jobs that no one wakes up excited about going to in the morning, and who then found himself sandbagged by the late-eighties recession, laid off in what must have felt like the worst kind of double whammy. All the adult trade-offs he’d made turned out to be a brutal bait-and-switch. Is it any wonder that the Grups have looked at that brand of adulthood and said, “No thanks, you can keep your carrot and your stick.” Especially once we saw just how easily that stick can be turned around to whap your ass as you’re ushered out the door, suit and all. Just how easily a bona fide, by-the-book adult can be made to wonder where it all went wrong, and why you ever bothered to grow up in the first place.
