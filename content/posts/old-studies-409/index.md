Not much happening on this blog. I might have to reconsider its future.

On the study front, last week I handed in my Literature Report after a long period of drudging through bad writing of others to create similar writing of my own.

It feels good having unloaded that burden and being able to focus on stuff I think is really important.

Last week Amanda and myself also had a meeting with my thesis supervisor Charles van der Mast. The meeting was pleasurable enough.
