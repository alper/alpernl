The weekly bit of media consisted of a brief Radio 1 excerpt about the issue of new anti-piracy legislation. This is of course futile and I did my best to explain such in [a couple of minutes](http://nos.nl/artikel/232279-illegaal-downloaden-wordt-echt-illegaal.html) and [a blogpost](/dingen/2011/04/downloadverbod-op-radio-1/).

Then did some setup work on _culiacan_. The rest of the week was filled with notable progress on Statlas and the rounding up and finishing of maguro.

Also inbetween all of this, I painted a room and moved house. Notifications of the new address and inaugural drinks forthcoming.
