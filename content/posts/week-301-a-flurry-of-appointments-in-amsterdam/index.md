Last Monday was the last day in Berlin before the holidays so something of a push here and there to get things to go through. That night we had a [vvvv](http://vvvv.org/) workshop at the studio hosted by Joreg to teach somewhere around eight people the basics of node based graphical environments (the only other one I had used extensively before was [Open DX](http://www.opendx.org/) and of course there's Quartz Composer and [Impure Quadrigram](http://impure.com/)).

I messed around a bit with it and managed to produce this bit of media art. It is very interesting to have the power of DirectX9 under your fingers without having to program at all, though the whole fact of non-programming feels a bit strange to me.

Also there was this bit about the journalistic climate in the Netherlands:

I would recommend anybody interfacing with journalists to be wholly guarded and keep clearly in mind what's in it for them in the interaction. The way it is played by most actors, it hasn't been about the uncovering of the truth for a long time.

Tuesday was my travel day to Amsterdam where I wrote a bunch of stuff in the train and had an Open State board meeting that evening.

I spent most of Wednesday in Utrecht at the [Hubbub](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/) studio. That night I had dinner with [Tim de Gier](http://timdegier.nl/), [Loeki Westerveld](https://twitter.com/loekiwesterveld) and [Justus Bruns](http://justusbruns.com/) partially by plan, partially by coincidence.

Thursday was also spent at Hubbub discussing business and getting work done. That night I had drinks with Kars and Lieke in a smashing [new Utrecht establishment](https://foursquare.com/v/de-drie-dorstige-herten/4ddec142fa769803ef992485).

On Friday I met Edo van Royen at [Studyflow](http://studyflow.nl/), had lunch with [Peter Robinett](http://www.bubblefoundry.com/), coffee with Justus Bruns, dropped by at my accountant, had a beer with [Thijs Niks](http://thijsniks.tumblr.com/) and then drinks at the Open Coop with Lex and Alexander. Having said that: these visits to the Netherlands always tend to devolve into a flurry of errands that barely leave any time to think. That is going to change for the next one.
