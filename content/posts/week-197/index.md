Got some reinforcements at the office:
[![Reinforcements have arrived](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5084/5276803255_ff793c3a78.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/5276803255/ "Reinforcements have arrived by illustir, on Flickr")

My business cards for Monster Swell have also arrived, more about those in a separate post: [Information Compression on Paper](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2010/12/information-compression/) [![Checking out Alper's hella sweet Monsterswell cards designed by BUROPONY](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5281/5282406301_58296a4143.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaeru/5282406301/ "Checking out Alper's hella sweet Monsterswell cards designed by BUROPONY by Kaeru, on Flickr")

Started writing a document describing the end of life of [TipiT](http://tipit.to) for our investors. Nothing new there but still interesting to reflect.

Took in [Dutchstats](http://monsterswell.com/blog/category/projects/dutchstats/) and starting planning that in earnest. Subsequently spent most of the day in Numbers. The phrase: “Project management is hard, let's go shopping.”did come to mind…

I had been increasingly frustrated with Dutch media's treatment of the [Wikileaks](http://wikileaks.org) affaire but also was somewhat too busy to write anything better. Inbetween business [Jaap](http://twitter.com/jaapstronks) and I posted a [‘drive-by essay’ on a week old nrc.next blog post](http://www.nrcnext.nl/blog/2010/12/15/de-cyberaanval-als-het-nieuwe-demonstreren/#comment-55625).

Wednesday was a kickoff on prototyping for [Maguro](http://leapfrog.nl/blog/?s=maguro) which needs to leave the ephemeral stage sometime quick. That night there also was a very [well curated Ignite](http://www.mediamatic.net/page/171344/en) at [Mediamatic](http://mediamatic.net) about games. Fifteen presentations is a bit on the long side, but none were really boring or bad due to [the Utrecht gaming scene](http://www.dutchgamegarden.nl) having come out in force.

The rest of the week was filled with more of the same and tying up loose ends for the end of the year.

[Our office](http://twitter.com/ouroffice) also said farewell to one of its members, typographic hero [Gustavo](http://hipertipo.net):
[![Gustavo under the new Sutro filter](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5165/5277156369_a0cfb57678.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/5277156369/ "Gustavo under the new Sutro filter by illustir, on Flickr")
A new addition is already eager to get started in the new year.
