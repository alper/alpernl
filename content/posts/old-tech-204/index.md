The company I'm working for currently —[TOPdesk](http://www.topdesk.com)— is organizing a [Coding Battle](http://www.tcb2006.nl/) Novemer 27th.

The aim is to program robots in Java Robocode and have them battle each other on a big cinema screen. It should provide fun. Free beer and snacks are of course provided.
