[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) is turning five and next Tuesday November 7th there's a [slew of parties](http://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipsebirthday5/birthdayparties.php) worldwide to celebrate the occasion.

I'm trying to organize the Dutch party. Exact details forthcoming, meanwhile you can sign [the birthday card](http://birthday.eclipse.org:80/images/map.php?individual).

**Update!** It's on. We're now [on the listing](http://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipsebirthday5/birthdayparties.php#delft) and you can check the [Upcoming event](http://upcoming.org/event/123655).
