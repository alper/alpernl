Learned in this podcast episode about class justice in Germany something rather remarkable.

Germany has a system of income dependent fines called _Tagessätze_. These are meant to make punishments more equitable by making people who make more money pay more.

It turns out (and I'm sure very few people are aware of this) that courts do not get access to tax records to determine the fine base. They take a guess at the income and most of the time, they guess too low.
