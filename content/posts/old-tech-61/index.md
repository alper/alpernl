It seems to be slightly impossible for me to select items from a HTML <select> control using the keyboard.

Tabbing it into focus does work, but using the down arrows to go through the possible options does not work. The lack of this very basic functionality is very frustrating when filling out a lot of web forms.

I did find a problem for my Safari crashing. Open the Activity Window, Command-A, Command-C gives me a list of all the urls of the tabs I have open currently. Great!
