The [presentations from the previous SuperHappyDevHouse](http://superhappydevhouse.com/node/9) are really cool. I had already seen the [Using Python to get money and chicks](http://www.lglan.net/shdh/shdh5/SHDH5-Python.mp4) but the following two are also very worth watching:

- [AjaxWar](http://www.lglan.net/shdh/shdh5/SHDH5-AjaxWar.mp4) is a very nice proof of concept real time strategy game in Javascript

- [Dojo Maps](http://www.lglan.net/shdh/shdh5/SHDH5-DojoMaps.mp4) is a GoogleMaps clone using Dojo

They have their [sixth iteration](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2005/12/10/shdh-0x06/) today.

**Update:** The [Laughing Squid](http://laughingsquid.com/2005/12/11/superhappydevhouse-6-getv-photos/) has [pictures from the night](http://flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/sets/1557007/).

Wouldn't it be fun to do more stuff like that here in our Dutch [polder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polder)?
