At last we managed to have ourselves [the meeting](/blog/study/378) with both of my sponsors to determine the course of action for my Masters.

We had a constructive meeting and I now have a clear vision of how I am going to proceed with my Masters. First stage is a quarter of the work (10 weeks) and involves doing a literature study of the topic at hand.

It feels good to finally have an official start of this big work of mine. Let's get to work.
