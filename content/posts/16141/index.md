I can't say I've read a lot of Beyond the Beyond nor been much of a happy Wired consumer in any case, but it's passing still marks the end of an era. I remember Bruce Sterling's closing speeches at SxSWi as one of the highlights of the conference (me being  too late an arrival to attend his house parties).
