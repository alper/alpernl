Some notes, this time not ordered by day, but by theme.

A bunch of conceptual and game design progress for Ebi. We created a concept which is fun, viral and not impossible to implement given the time we have. Also big thanks for the baristas at [Brandmeester's](http://foursquare.com/venue/332270) for keeping the creativity fueled.

Signup at [the mental stimulation Google Wave](https://wave.google.com/wave/waveref/googlewave.com/w+3aV30UWtA) (still a free spot left for this week!).

I attended [all](http://www.mediamatic.net/page/152173/en) [three](http://www.mediamatic.net/page/152172/en) [days](http://www.mediamatic.net/page/152165/en) of the Mediamatic Mapping Festival. There was a lot of familiar stuff there but still saw some interesting things (see [Monster Swell's](http://twitter.com/monsterswell) [tweets](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=from:monsterswell+mapfest)) and talked to some cool people (among who [catalogtree](http://www.catalogtree.net/)). The amount of interactive data visualizations was somewhat disappointing. It is about time we transformed data and insight into read/write media.

Some writing:

- [“Distilling meter, rhyme and verse from your database”](/dingen/2010/07/distilling-meter-rhyme-and-verse-from-your-database/) about the need for data storytelling
- A summary of a recent Dutch commission's report on traffic information systems in Dutch [“Eindrapport Adviescommissie Verkeersinformatie”](/dingen/2010/07/eindrapport-adviescommissie-verkeersinformatie/)

Some updates on [Haïtinu.nl](http://haitinu.nl) a site I have been working on.
