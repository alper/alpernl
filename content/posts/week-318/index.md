Unbelievable how many weeks behind I am on these. That's not wholly intended, but the last couple of weeks have been a bit busier than usual. This was the week of April 15th which I spent mostly in Amsterdam.

I spent a full day with the team on Tuesday working on [KAIGARA](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/?s=kaigara&searchsubmit=Search):

I drank very awesome coffee that [Angelo had brought back](http://www.thevillagecoffee.nl/) from his road trip along the west coast of the USA:

We celebrated shipping some projects that night with Kars and Simon and the next day I was back at Hubbub for another day of work. That night it was off to [the Open State offices](http://openstate.eu/) in Amsterdam for a bit of envisioning with our new managing director. A very solid and constructive session, well catered by our in-house team of [Bite Me](http://www.biteme.co.nl/):

My work setup at the brilliant [Koko](http://ilovekoko.com/):

The Thursday I spent working at the [Open Coop](http://opencoop.nl/) and preparing my Python programming course I gave on the now defunct [Gidsy](https://gidsy.com/).

Friday I took the train back to Berlin and it was confirmed to me again that train companies are stupid. If I take a different train to Berlin I need to pay the difference in distance even if I start and end in the same place:

And Saturday I also managed squeeze out [a long overdue Recess!](/dingen/2013/04/recess-10/).

So lots of stuff and more to follow.
