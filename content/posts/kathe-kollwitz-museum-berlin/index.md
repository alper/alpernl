Today I got a tour of the [Käthe Kollwitz museum](http://www.kaethe-kollwitz.de/) in Berlin. I had wanted to visit this museum for a while but this proved the concrete reason to finally go (though [the café next door](https://foursquare.com/v/caf%C3%A9-restaurant-wintergarten/4adcda78f964a5205c4621e3) makes some mean pancakes if you find yourself in the area).

I was recently attended to her existence by MacGregor's series on German history ( [episode](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04k6t0s)). I now believe that she is one of the most important German artists of the past couple of centuries. If there are any other significant candidates, I would like to hear about them ((I discount Caspar David Friedrich because he was a painter of landscapes.)).

What makes her stand out as an artist are:

- Her mastery of both drawing and sculpture.
- That she depicts ‘common’ people and social themes prominently. She thought these people were beautiful in their own way and that their plight was one that merited attention. For me this is a stark contrast with how current (artistic) elites try to ignore the ‘common and stupid’ people (like [Trump voters](https://medium.com/@girlziplocked/who-cares-if-senators-remember-to-wipe-their-chins-after-they-finish-blowing-chevron-242f9e5c8fc5#.bz1g6zt2z)).
- The loss of her son and how that permeates her later work.

Our tour guide didn't make the connection but I find it more than fitting that on May 1st we would be looking at for instance the Weavers cycle (one of which I have pasted below).
