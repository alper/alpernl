> Were Germans supposed to be particularly ordered and machinelike? Was it possible that Germans really were ordered and machinelike?

> There was no way to go through life, in Turkish or any other language, making only factual statements about direct observations. You were forced to use -miş, just by the human condition—just by existing in relation to other people.

> I liked Spanish—I liked how the donkey had a place in the national literature

> How would I get anywhere in life? How could anyone ever be interested in me?

> But I couldn’t stop thinking about á and Ã —about Europe, where even the alphabet emitted exuberant sparks—about Ivan’s mother’s Mazda, and how you were always sad when you left Rome.

> “You really like this boy,”she said, sounding so sad and affectionate that tears came to my eyes.

> “I feel like a kid.”
>
> “Like a little girl, huh? It must be really terrible for you.”
>
> “I learned Turkish when I was three, so I don’t know enough words. I can’t talk about anything,”I said.

> “Of course he will. Womanizers always call back. That’s their best quality.”

> “Stuff like that can really bring out the sadist in you,”he said. “I’m standing there thinking of all the different ways I’ll rip out this guy’s guts.”

> And still no waking moment went by that I didn’t think of him—he was in the background of everything I thought. My own perceptions were no longer enough to constitute the physical world for me. Every sound, every syllable that reached me, I wanted to filter through his consciousness. At a word from him I would have followed him anywhere, right off the so-called Prudential Center.

> “In Turkey? You wouldn’t have a nervous breakdown. You’d give them a nervous breakdown.”I forgave him for a lot when he said that. I forgave him for almost everything.

> A less beautiful girl wouldn’t have said that, I thought. Beautiful people lived in a different world, had different relations with people. From the beginning they were raised for love.
