Drive by-ing these notes twothree four days late. Yeah, these are those kind of weeks.

Gave my first lecture on data visualization at the [Willem de Kooning](http://www.wdka.nl/). That was fun.

Then after I went straight to [This Happened Utrecht #9](http://thishappened.nl/).

Met with the people behind [IAmsterdam](http://iamsterdam.com/) and updated on [Statlas](http://statlas.nl) with [Kilian Valkhof](http://www.kilianvalkhof.com).

Found this [permalink](http://vimeo.com/15104279):

Finalized the rules for _maguro_ and codified them.

Spent a day at [Buro Pony](http://www.buropony.nl/) working on a very aesthetic affair.

After that it's mostly a blur of hustling at _maguro_. Staying in at the studio 'till midnight day after day. Hard hours but good work and company. So no biggie.

Quoting [Jack Schulze](http://berglondon.com/blog/2011/02/11/week-296/): “It’s brilliant to have these people around.”

And finally the version was finished and we went off boozing.

In the weekend it was mostly doing catchup on other projects. Did the briefing and wireframes for _hermosillo_. Updated [the event page](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/2011/01/hack-de-overheid-3-maart-11-2011/) for March 12th's [Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl).

Then closed off the day with an architectural dinner.

Touched up some stuff on Sunday and prepared my WdKA lecture of the following day.
