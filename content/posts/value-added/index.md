The Dutch government is thinking of increasing the VAT from its current 19% to 20% at the end of this year ( [source](http://frontpage.fok.nl/nieuws/94214)). That may seem like a lot, but for instance in Denmark I believe it stands at 25% and Denmark is a pretty nice country.

I'm curious to the rationale of such an increase of 1%. Why increase it at all? In the current political climate it will only increase perception that _Jan Modaal_ ((Dutch for the Average Joe.)) is being screwed over by government. And why then not increase it directly to 25% or 50%, if it's such a good thing?

In other news a radio commercial claiming that ‘taxation is theft’ ( [source](http://frontpage.fok.nl/nieuws/94181)) was banned this week.
