I am considering discontinuing this blog here and concentrating my English writing efforts on our new and soon to be launched weblog [Four Starters.com](http://fourstarters.com).

I haven't been doing much or writing much about hard technology lately and my writings about web trends and business are a good fit for Four Starters.

Discontinuing this blog is going to happen in any case because I am going to migrate everything here to [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com) and make all the content static. Dreamhost does not offer Zope hosting (nor would I want it if they did).

For my Dutch blog I will be installing a fresh [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) but not for this one or at least not immediately.

(Feed URLs and the like will be redirected, so you shouldn't notice.)

Your thoughts?
