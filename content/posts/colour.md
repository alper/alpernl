I so wish that the icons in the app made more sense and that the flow between states was clearer, but my wishes really don't matter that much.

[Color](http://colour.com) has flow. You can just keep doing stuff and you go fluidly from one screen to the other even though it may not be clear what every screen is for or why the various elements on the screens are where they are. You can do a lot, it all moves and feels rather magical. It's more like a game than anything else.

Better yet, the spatial dislocation forces you not to be anal about organizing or sharing or any of the other features photo sharing apps would normally bother you with (and force you to learn). Indeed that is the promise they make: don't find/add your friends, don't organize your pictures, just snap away as you will and Colour will take care of all the rest.

This is smart, gutsy, well executed, it promises to _Not Make Me Think_ and I'm almost ready to let go. Almost.
