A [small post about the Interactive Environments](http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=1cc7669a-0a71-4399-91e5-9898d6f9fc49&lang=nl) exhibit at my alma mater. I had to be in Rotterdam anyway that day so I decided to drop by.

There's some confusion at Delft Science Center whether the exhibit is really open to the public, but it isn't locked, so just head [there](http://foursquare.com/venue/908032) and take the first door on your right. Maybe because of the confusion, the machines aren't turned on, so it's a rather static display of interactive environments.

Some pictures:
