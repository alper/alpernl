Travel is making it hard to keep up writing these notes weekly (or write anything for that matter). So this blog is [turning into an expensive affair](http://ironbloggerberlin.com/).

Way back when this happened I was in the Netherlands for an appointment that was cancelled and because of that I had to fly to Munich from Amsterdam for a day of workshopping. The next night I flew back to Amsterdam to spend the rest of the week at [Hubbub](http://hubbub.eu/) HQ in the Netherlands.

We did our strategic sessions about which I probably have written elsewhere already but this was as good a time as any to revisit this brilliant interview with Jack Schulze. They don't make them like that anymore.

> No one cares about what you think, unless you do what you think. No one cares what you do, unless you think about what you do. No one ever really cares what you say.

Advice to frame and put above your desk.

The last day I did a coffee tour of Amsterdam, which is in utter bloom at this moment with Third Wave coffee places opening up literally left and right. I paid a duty visit to [BrunsNiks](http://brunsniks.com/) which is one of the best up and coming design firms of that city where most stuff is bullshit.

What is also brilliant are the new Hackers and Founders offices of [the eponymous meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Amsterdam-NL/). My [old office in the Volkskrantgebouw](https://twitter.com/ouroffice) got evicted because they are turning that into a hotel (like pretty much everything in Amsterdam) so they got together with the neighbors of [Bottlenose](http://bottlenose.com/) and some other friends and rented a nice floor smack in Amsterdam city centre. I can't take any credit for what they did but still I'm half proud of what that turned into.

And that segued nicely into the speaker's dinner for our [Hack de Overheid](http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/) event (which got a nice [press release drop over at Wired](http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2013/06/apps-for-europe/) thanks to Bruce). The event, the next day in City Hall, was one where all of the founders were present at one and the same location. That already was amazing. After the day was finished I spent the evening talking philosophy with [Simeon](http://ndkv.nl/).

And the next day it was back in the train to Berlin which has added a whole hour because the flooding has damaged a bridge and caused a large stretch of tracks to be dislodged. Deutsche Bahn says that reconstruction will take until December. That may be just in time for next year's flooding.
