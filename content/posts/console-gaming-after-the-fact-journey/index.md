This is just a lovely experience. A small, beautiful, near perfect game with graphics that have held up excellently over time. Are there more games like this? If not there should be. This has such a broad appeal and playability.

Some of the transitions are among the most beautiful things I've seen in gaming. The sunset sand surf through the mountain in shimmering gold ( [video on YouTube](http://youtu.be/bkL94nKSd2M?t=30m58s)) stands out but most of it is excellent.

What comes to mind with regards to aesthetics and also breaking out of the ‘gamer’ confines is this year's hit [Monument Valley](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/) but we could use a lot more.
