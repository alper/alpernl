Staying up all night to watch the elections we finally saw Barack Obama's victory speech somewhere after 5AM. Though at that moment I couldn't fully appreciate it, it was one of his best speeches and one ending a period.

We're only at the beginning and the things he does from now on are those that really matter. Everything until now a prelude of some sorts. It will be interesting to see how his transition goes and who he appoints to be in his staff and cabinet.

In the meantime just to reminisce about how good a campaign he ran, what a phenomenal communicator he is and how he just comes across as a very sympathetic and funny guy, here a brilliant anecdote from the campaign trail. Watch it and then analyze its communicational layering; sheer and utter brilliance.
