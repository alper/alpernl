Web 2.0 startups and social sharing being what they may, I have very mixed feelings about [slideshare](http://slideshare.net/).

It is a nice product and does facilitate a larger need of sharing decks or single slides to enable viewing without the horribe PowerPoint and commenting on. This is good.

What is less so is that it makes it really convenient for bloggers [to embed slideshows](http://www.upstream.nl/comments.php?id=337_0_1_0_C) in their posts as if they are self-explaining.

Most business decks are so dense and convoluted, you are doing your audience a severe disservice by subjecting them to unedited unaccompanied versions.

People uploading to slideshare should first be subjected to [the Cognitive Style of PowerPoint](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_pp) or an equal measure of [Presentation Zen](http://www.presentationzen.com).

Oh yeah, they don't accept raw [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/) files which pretty much precludes receiving any presentations worth looking at.
