The summer may not have brought the best weather but still good times are around. This week finishing off some work before we'll be going on an ill-prepared week long surftrip somewhere along the French Atlantic coast.

Seasoned travellers as we deem ourselves and busy as we are, we have dispensed with most of the preparation one would think would be necessary. We have some camping equipment, surfboards and roof carriers and lots of good humour to go around. That should be enough for any holiday.

That's also a reason I won't be getting my iPhone 3G right away like a lot of people are. I'm planning on travelling some more and this device is more of a hindrance ((€30 per MB of data consumed abroad!?)) and a risk than it is a benefit on the road.

I'm still debating whether or not I should take my laptop. Odds of us finding solid power let alone WiFi are slim and 7GB of CF memory should be enough for a week's holiday: 1GB/day. And a week of disconnection will probably do me more good than I realize.
