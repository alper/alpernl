Last week featured some taxes, and a write-up of our gamejam efforts [in nrc.ne](http://instagr.am/p/mgcfj/) xt post-published on Bashers: [The Making of Nakatomi Rider](http://bashers.nl/ggj12-nakatomi-rider).

On Tuesday I went to c-base for Hack and Tell which featured some rather interesting hacks, a low douchebag count and some nice pizza.

On Wednesday I did the last work on a project from last year. Then I went to see a shared office in Kreuzkölln before going to the [Games Culture Circle](http://www.amaze-festival.de/games-culture-circle/) (sort of similar to Gamelab in Amsterdam).

On Friday I went to see [Agora](http://www.agoracollective.org/) based on a tip by [Peter Bihr](http://www.thewavingcat.com/) and I decided to setup shop there for the time being. Having a studio increases my productivity some four times. The rest of the day and weekend was spent getting back into XCode and into the iOS deployment process.

I also blogged about the 2012 Q1 events schedule both [personally](/dingen/2012/02/early-2012-events/) and [professionally](http://monsterswell.com/blog/2012/02/early-2012-schedule/).

On Saturday I did make it out to the Haus der Kulturen der Welt to get a taste of the Transmediale, but I was a bit overwhelmed by the quantity and unclarity of the program so I didn't do more than take a look around. I think the entire obscurantist tendency surrounding net art is highly problematic and negates any relevance the field may have. I did catch the [Graham Harman](http://doctorzamalek2.wordpress.com/) keynote on the live stream which would have been worth admission by itself.
