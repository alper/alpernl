Interesting [article on Wired](http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,69475,00.html?tw=rss.TOP) about if video games can provoke emotions in players beyond simple victory and frustration. To see if people get carried away so totally into a game that they make personal connections with a character.

The question is:

> ‘Did a videogame ever make you cry?’

The killing of [Aerith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerith_Gainsborough) in Final Fantasy VII is named as a pivotal moment in video game history with regards to emotional weight. I cannot find an image or movie of that scene. If anybody can, I woul be very interested to see it.

A similar question was posed concerning the medium of photography last week in De Wereld Draait Door. [Erwin Olaf was present Friday](http://dewerelddraaitdoor.vara.nl/terugkijken.php?id=30) and they showed some fragments of his new movie work.

One of the reasons he gave for moving on to the more complicated discipline of movies was that movies have a greater capacity to touch people on an emotional level. Ask yourself the question have ever cried over a photograph? Over a movie?

I knew some [work by Olaf](http://www.erwinolaf.com/) before and I must say that his movie work had the same feeling about it but was much much more compelling.

A similar extrapolation can be made from movies to videogames. Videogames are becoming more and more realistic and have the added component of interaction and user identification to provide for a far deeper almost enveloping experience.
