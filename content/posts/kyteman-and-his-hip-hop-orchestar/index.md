For my international audience; if you've been living in the Netherlands you could not have missed this.

Yesterday night we saw a live gig here in Delft by [Kyteman](http://www.kyteman.com/) ( [myspace](http://www.myspace.com/kyteman)) and his hip-hop orchestra and we stood agape with wonder. This guy is a recent musical sensation in the Netherlands and if you can catch a show by him run to it!

Kyteman is a hip-hop artist/conductor with a trumpet who leads a 21 piece orchestar with a full brass section, a string section and a host of M.C.s. A definite mashup formation with hip-hop, funky and blues sounds. I write orchestar because it is reminiscent even of more balkan influences like Bregović and Beirut ((It would be very awesome if they purposefully included balkan and maybe even arabesk influences.)). The sound they produce is rich and dynamic and the performances spectacular in their grandeur.

The music is awesome, but the live gig is where it's at. 3voor12 made [a composition of audience recordings](http://3voor12.vpro.nl/tv/#/41129661/42049946/6) at Pinkpop to give you an idea of the explosion.
