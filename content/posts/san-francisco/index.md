I've always wanted to go there and tomorrow I'm finally going. Some vague plans, tads of serendipity and friends pushing me over the edge were enough to have me book the ticket, I think, only three weeks ago. Tomorrow Lufthansa will take me over an ocean for the first time of my life [^1].

Halfway during the trip there's a [four day capoeira event](http://www.capoeiraarts.com/batizado/index.html) celebrating [Mestre Acordeon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestre_Acordeon)'s fiftieth year of teaching capoeira with [a Brazilian festival in Berkeley](http://www.capoeiraarts.com/brazilfest/index.html) on Saturday. I'll also try to get some surfing in and see if I can visit the local tech hubs and meet some people, so it's not purely a holiday.

If this wasn't enough to stress me out, today my laptop decided to not boot anymore. So I spent most of the day [panicing](http://twitter.com/alper/statuses/951211098) and restoring a backup, after which everything seems to work again but no clue for how long. Maybe I should try to sneak a new Macbook past customs on my way back.

Take care, I'll be back the 27th.
