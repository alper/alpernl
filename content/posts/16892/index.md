Reading about China's message board theorists is amazing and makes me wish I could have stuck with Chinese. But then again I would have not learned it well enough probably ever to be able to follow what's happening on the Chinese internet, so this will have to do.

Reading this I learned an absurd amount about China that I didn't know yet.
