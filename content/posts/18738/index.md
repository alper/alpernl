A revealing account of how using LLMs to do the thinking for you is not actual thinking but a sub-cognitive shortcut.

> My thinking systems have atrophied, and I can feel it–I can sense my slightly diminishing intuition, cleverness, and rigor.

> LLMs give me finished thoughts, polished and convincing, but none of the intellectual growth that comes from developing them myself.

A modern day paradox: You can have all the thoughts you want but none of them will be worth anything.
