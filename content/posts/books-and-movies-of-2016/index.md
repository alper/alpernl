Like every year the books I read and the movies I watched. Recommended ones are in bold.

### Books

The book situation was shameful but instead of reading a lot of books, I wrote [“Designing Conversational Interfaces”](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32560547-designing-conversational-interfaces?from_search=true), so I'll call that even.
