Last week I finished the book[^1] “In the Bubble” by John [Thackara](http://www.thackara.com/) ([my summary](/wiki/index.php/In_the_Bubble_:_Designing_in_a_Complex_World)).

The book is part of a tradition of more recent popular scientific book in that it practices science-by-anecdote. It is a vast collection of mostly interesting anecdotes, tidbits from other scientists, entertaining stories and luminous examples conveniently arranged chapterwise in trends. It is very personal and at times a bit careless but mostly interesting.

The book does read well and spouts its vision to make the reader aware of the problems we are faced with and their possible solutions. This has become more and more necessary as we are faced daily with systems which are completely out of touch with the human(e).
