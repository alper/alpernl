This afternoon I got a chance to test drive a Vista build thanks to [Cris](http://www.ibbydibby.com/cbetta/blog/tech.htm) who followed a link from [my delicious](http://del.icio.us/alper/vista) and installed it on his 2G RAM Macbook.

After using it I must say it is an awfully composed, badly copied piece of crap. However, it does look half way sexy. They must have managed to lure a designer into the pits of Redmond.

Windows users are going to love it or defect en masse to OS X and Ubuntu. I found this [strange editorial](http://www.osweekly.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2335) about the subject.

Cris is a monster. In one weekend he managed to install both Vista and Leopard on his Macbook. Talk about being cutting edge. If anyone knows who has the edge, he does.
