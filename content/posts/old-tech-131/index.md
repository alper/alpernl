more bandwidth

digital television, more choice

Freeview (30 digital tv channels, some audio) as an API?

Rich

Open

Well structured

Scalable

Very High Availability

Accessible

Proven

License?

Documented (closed standard)?

Disk storage is also increasing exponentially

1TB stores 4 channels for a week

television is a very inefficient means of distributing information

you miss a lot of the things you would like to watch

Suppose you could record EVERYTHING (Time Machine)

When you have so much choice existing TV interfaces do not cut it

Need better metadata

People like to browse by actors 'stuff with X in it'

Recode to MPEG4 -> 1TB stores a channel for 3 months

made an internal site for BBC use of all programs with a web based frontend

channel information is worth saving because it has a brand associated with it

social scheduling proved to be very popular

Yahoo! term extractor to generate tags for entries

closed beta, would have been too popular for general use

(So people want this kind of stuff. What are we going to do to give it to them? ~Alper

Why is it illegal for people to pool their resources?)

Broadcasters would want to incorporate metadata to enable people to find their programs. You want people to come to your program.
