Interesting to see that there were a ton of election result charting, display and visualization sites that popped up just before the elections. It seems that this is a hot topic.

We just added a preliminary dataset with yesterday's election results. If you want to see the decimation of the CDA and the blue spread with the rise of the VVD (also compared with the municipal elections earlier this year), see here: [http://bit.ly/a7s3l2](http://bit.ly/a7s3l2) [![Quick entry of 2010 parliamentary election results](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4066/4687603715_5c1b01b7f4.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/4687603715/ "Quick entry of 2010 parliamentary election results by illustir, on Flickr")

There are some outstanding results and some outstanding todos for the map which explain the holes. Those will be fixed shortly when the entire map migrates to the 2009 Shapefile.
