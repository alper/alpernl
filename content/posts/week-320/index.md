The week before last started out with me still in Paris sampling the local coffee scene which has been improving massively over the past year or so.

[Télescope](https://foursquare.com/v/t%C3%A9lescope/4f684076e4b0b4f791ce4f7f) already was nice:

But with the addition of [Loustic](https://foursquare.com/v/loustic/5149c2738aca0ead6a573ce5), French coffee can finally be taken seriously again:
[![Very nice place and only open for six weeks now.](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8405/8691848065_45c31a4b45_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/8691848065/ "Very nice place and only open for six weeks now. by illustir, on Flickr")

Most of these places seem to be run by English speaking expatriates and they are also mostly frequented by the same. This was something I also noticed at my coworking space in La Cantine. It seems that foreigners are a necessary mediator to introduce new things —digital or coffee— into French culture.

That Tuesday I worked at [KANT](https://foursquare.com/v/kant--kreuzberg-academy-for-nerdery-and-tinkering/51238e70e4b04e6a13aaddc9) and all of the people there presented roughly what they're doing at the agency we sublease at [Panorama3000](http://p3000.net/).

I was thinking of writing a screensaver that does the live OSM viewer [‘Show me the way’](http://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/), but it turns out there's a way easier solution by plugging that URL into the [WebView Screensaver](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver).

That Wednesday I did a quick ignite for [UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com/) on [Beestenbende's](http://whatsthehubbub.nl/projects/beestenbende/) design aspects and the next day I was at Heimathafen Neukölln at 06:00 to help them with setup and registration. I managed to catch a bit of the conference and based on the content on stage and reactions in the room, it looks like it was a resounding success.

The next day I spent working at the office for most of the day, but in the evening I dropped by the UIKode hackathon to show the iOS project I had picked up again that week. More on that to be announced here soon.
