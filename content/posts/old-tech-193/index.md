Thomas Madsen Mygdal's presentation at Shift shows how framing issues is very important in how they are perceived. Language shapes our thought.

The slide on pirates is especially telling:

> **Pirates**

> A girl giving a friend a copy of a cd

> Doing an interesting playlist

> A guy recording a song from the radio

> A criminal making money from duplicating cd’s

> P2P Filesharing

> The spreading of culture across the globe

> Our individual right to copy

> Borrowing somebody a dvd

> Copying a dvd to your computer

> Sharing the memory of an experience

> Millions of people sharing movies and music
