I found a new German podcast crush in Hart Unfair which is my favorite format: three people (Anna Dushime, Yelda Türkmen and Ari Christmann) rambling through one another but in a way that's funny, intelligent and diverse. It's a shame that they publish so irregularly that I can't tell if the podcast is dead or not.

One of the hosts dropped a casual [Hasan Piker](https://www.youtube.com/c/hasanabi) reference (in a conversation about pop culture and leftist politics) and… I didn't even know there were Germans who know who that is.
