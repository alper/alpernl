By the time this post has been published I will be on a train on my way to Schiphol to fly to Copenhagen to attend the 10th edition of [Reboot](http://reboot.dk) [^1].

Copenhagen has become familiar territory and I'll be there for only four days. Acclimatizing on Wednesday which kicks off with a boat trip. Thursday and Friday will be conference days during which I hope to see a lot of people and I have been alotted a small session where we'll talk about [Free Economies](http://www.reboot.dk/artefact-5148-en.html).

Saturday will be spent recovering, maybe a run along the lakes or a decent brunch or burger and Saturday evening my train will depart for the Netherlands. The train journey back I'm looking forward to a lot more than the plane ride in.
