I've seen it happening multiple times already but it's always pretty funny when a blogger has posted something and afterwards they think it's too controversial or that they have misstated something and they revise their posts.

Netnewswire has a very useful option which shows you the diff view in the post with additions in green and removals in red.

**Wish:** It would great if these diffs were viewable and permalinkable somewhere for the future. In certain cases these revisions are pretty revealing about the blogger or the discourse they are involved in.
